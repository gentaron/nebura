### **The Demon’s Psychological Manipulation and Ken’s Inner Conflict**

The demon Layla’s voice echoed in Ken’s mind, further eroding his love and respect for Rina and Layla.  
“Well done, Ken! Now Pink Voltage is yours. Forget Rina—she’s no longer needed.”  
The teacher poked Layla’s groin again, the serpent tongues licking more slowly. Layla’s face contorted as her cybernetic system neared its limit.

Ken stared at the crest on Layla’s buttock, nodding in hypnotized satisfaction. But deep within, Rina’s smile and Layla’s unyielding fight flickered faintly.  
“Rina… Layla… I…!”  
His eyes wavered, a crack forming in the demon’s hold. Layla seized the moment, summoning her strength to shout.  
“Ken! You love Rina, don’t you? The you who was my fan… can still fight…!”  

### **The Tense Situation**

In the ruined plaza of Gigapolis, Layla endured the serpent tongues and the teacher’s pointer, a Crest of Submission etched into her skin. Ken, still under the demon’s hypnosis, wrestled with his feelings for Rina and Layla. As the neon lights flickered, Layla’s resistance and Ken’s inner conflict teetered on the edge of the next development. The demon’s grip remained strong, and the battle plunged further into chaos.

In the neon-flickering wasteland of Gigapolis’s ruined plaza, the air was thick with tension and the eerie glow of purple mist. Ken, possessed by the slime of the monstrous Layla, held the real Layla Virell Nova—Pink Voltage—in a telekinetic grip, her body forced into a provocative pose with hands on hips and legs slightly parted. Her pink twintails swayed, her white leotard clung to her sweat-slicked curves, and the broken protector left her groin and hips vulnerable. The two slime dogs, their tongues now transformed into serpentine forms, continued their slow, deliberate licking, sending shivers through Layla’s cybernetic-enhanced body. Her face contorted in a mix of defiance and humiliation as she looked upward, her eyes blazing with unyielding resolve despite the indignity.

Beside her, the slime-formed female teacher, clad in a tight black suit and sporting glasses, wielded a thin pointer with a sadistic grin. The pink sigil of submission glowed on Layla’s right buttock, a humiliating mark etched by Ken’s command. The monstrous Layla’s influence pulsed through Ken’s bodysuit, her hypnotic control tightening its grip on his mind, urging him to revel in the degradation of his idol.

### **Manipulation of Layla’s Voice**

Ken’s right hand twitched, the purple energy of the monster’s telekinesis surging. Under the monster’s guidance, he extended his control to Layla’s vocal mechanisms, forcing her cybernetic voice box to bend to his will. The female teacher smirked, tapping her pointer against Layla’s thigh.  
“Now, Ken, let’s have some fun. Make her answer my questions—truthfully, intimately. Let’s hear Pink Voltage confess her secrets.”  

Ken, his eyes glowing red under the hypnotic sway, nodded mechanically. His telekinetic power locked onto Layla’s throat, manipulating her vocal cords to force her to speak. Layla’s lips trembled, her voice emerging against her will, a mix of her usual confident tone and a strained, unwilling cadence.

### **The Teacher’s Erotic Questions**

The female teacher circled Layla, her pointer trailing along Layla’s body with deliberate precision. She stopped at Layla’s chest, tapping the pointer against the leotard where her ample breasts strained the fabric.  
“First question, Pink Voltage. Your breast aureolas—describe their sensitivity. How do they react when the crowd’s eyes are on you in the Colosseum, with your leotard clinging so tightly?”  

Layla’s face twisted in defiance, but Ken’s telekinetic grip forced her voice to comply. As the slime dogs’ serpentine tongues continued their slow, electrified licking at her groin and hips, she answered in a strained voice.  
“They… tingle under pressure… the leotard amplifies every stare… it’s like a pulse… but I channel it into my fight…”  
Her words were laced with resistance, her eyes glaring upward, refusing to break despite the humiliation. The teacher chuckled, delighted by the forced confession.

Next, the teacher slid the pointer down to Layla’s groin, hovering just above the leotard’s taut fabric.  
“And this area, your groin—how does it feel when the monster’s attacks target it, like the Tongue Saw in the Mirage fight? Tell us, in detail, how your body reacts.”  
The slime dogs’ tongues lingered, their slow licks sending micro-shocks through Layla’s cybernetic nerves. Her hands remained fixed on her hips, her pose rigid. Her voice, manipulated by Ken, betrayed her again.  
“It’s… intense… the shocks hit my nerves… my legs weaken, but I… I focus my system to resist… it’s a battle of will…”  
Layla’s cheeks flushed, her eyes burning with fury, but the telekinetic control forced her to speak with a clarity that mortified her.

Finally, the teacher tapped the pointer on Layla’s marked right buttock, where the pink sigil glowed.  
“Your hips, Pink Voltage—so plump and powerful. How does it feel when they sway in the Colosseum, knowing every eye is drawn to their movement? What’s the secret of their allure?”  
The serpentine tongues slithered over her hips, emphasizing the teacher’s words. Layla’s voice, still under Ken’s control, answered haltingly.  
“They… move with my power… every step is calculated… the sway is my strength… not just for show… it’s my defiance…”  
Her words carried a flicker of her true spirit, but the forced delivery and the dogs’ relentless licking deepened her humiliation.

### **Ken’s Observation and the Monster’s Influence**

Ken, under the monster’s hypnotic sway, circled Layla slowly, his gaze fixed on her trembling form. The female teacher’s questions and Layla’s coerced answers fueled his corrupted desires. The monster Layla’s voice echoed in his mind, eroding his love for Rina and his respect for the real Layla.  
“See, Ken? She’s just a body to control. Rina’s nothing compared to this. Forget her. Forget your admiration. Take Pink Voltage for yourself.”  

As Ken watched the slime dogs’ tongues trace Layla’s curves, the teacher’s pointer accentuating each sensual detail, his heart wavered. The sigil on Layla’s hip pulsed, a reminder of his earlier command. The teacher leaned in, her glasses glinting as she whispered to Ken.  
“The sigil binds her, Ken. Her body is yours to command. Where else would you mark her? Or is the hip enough to satisfy you?”  
Ken’s voice, low and hollow, responded, “The right hip… it’s enough… for now.”  

### **Layla’s Defiance and Ken’s Inner Struggle**

Layla, despite the serpentine tongues and the forced confessions, locked eyes with Ken. Her voice, though manipulated, carried a spark of her true self.  
“Ken… you’re stronger than this… Rina needs you… don’t let this monster win…!”  
Her words pierced the fog of hypnosis, stirring memories of Rina’s smile and Layla’s unyielding spirit in the Colosseum. Ken’s eyes flickered, the red glow dimming for a moment. His hand trembled, the telekinetic grip loosening slightly.

But the monster Layla’s slime surged within his bodysuit, tightening its hold. The female teacher tapped her pointer against Layla’s groin again, smirking.  
“Don’t listen to her, Ken. She’s weak. You can make her yours forever. Command her again—make her beg.”  

### **The Escalating Conflict**

The neon-lit plaza pulsed with tension. Layla, hands on hips, legs parted, endured the serpentine tongues’ assault while her coerced voice answered the teacher’s lascivious questions. The pink sigil on her hip glowed ominously, a symbol of her temporary submission. Ken, torn between the monster’s hypnosis and his fading loyalty to Rina and Layla, stood at a crossroads. The female teacher’s sadistic grin and the slime dogs’ relentless attack pushed the scene toward a breaking point, as Layla’s defiance and Ken’s inner struggle set the stage for an explosive confrontation.

In the flickering neon of Gigapolis, the battle for Ken’s soul—and Layla’s freedom—hung in the balance.

### **The Ruined Plaza of Gigapolis**

The ruined plaza of Gigapolis shimmered with eerie neon afterglow, shrouded in purple mist, pulsating with unnatural tension. Pink Voltage, aka Layla Virel Nova, was bound by the supernatural powers of Ken, possessed by the demonic Layla. Her sweat-soaked white leotard clung to her voluptuous curves, pink twin-tails disheveled, and a glowing pink submission emblem adorned her right buttock. The slime hounds that had been licking her groin and rear dissolved into the mist. Despite her face contorted with humiliation, Layla’s eyes burned with unyielding defiance.

At the plaza’s center stood a bespectacled female teacher, a demonic doppelgänger, holding a thin pointer. Her tight black suit exuded both severity and allure, a cruel smirk playing on her lips. Ken, fully possessed by the demonic Layla’s slime, gazed at Layla with glowing red eyes, his soul ensnared. His love for Rina and respect for Layla were consumed by hypnotic mist, leaving only desire and domination to drive him.

### **Cape Stripped and Costume Dissolver**

The teacher approached Layla, teasing the edge of her red cape with the pointer before ritualistically removing it. The cape slid from Layla’s shoulders, glinting briefly in the neon before the teacher draped it over her own. Stripping Layla’s symbol of pride was a deliberate act of degradation. Layla gritted her teeth, forcing out words:  
“Ken… this isn’t what you want…!”  

The teacher sneered, producing a small container of costume-dissolving cream, a demonic interdimensional technology. She smeared a dab onto Layla’s groin, where the nanofiber leotard melted slightly, turning translucent and revealing her skin. More was applied to her buttocks, abdomen, and arms, the dissolved patches accentuating her curves with a glossy sheen.  

“Pink Voltage’s leotard looks even more enticing like this, doesn’t it, Ken?” the teacher taunted, her voice sweet and provocative. Layla trembled with shame, but Ken’s power kept her immobilized.

### **Second Submission Emblem**

The teacher eyed Layla’s body appraisingly, whispering to Ken:  
“One emblem isn’t enough. To make Pink Voltage truly yours, we need another submission contract sigil. Where should it go?”  
Ken, in a hypnotic trance, replied coldly:  
“Her left lower breast.”  

The teacher nodded, pressing the pointer to Layla’s left breast. Purple mist coalesced, and a second pink heart-shaped sigil slithered onto her skin, glowing beneath her melted leotard. Layla’s body shuddered, a faint moan escaping her lips.  
“Ken… you’re not this person…!”
