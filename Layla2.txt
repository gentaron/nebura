Below the endless night sky woven with the neon of Gigapolis, Layla Virel Nova streaks like a comet bursting from a rift in the digital world, her vibrant pink twin-tails streaming behind her. Her presence transcends mere humanity. A cybernetically enhanced body, a burning will for justice, and above all, an irrepressible life force—that is Layla, known as "Pink Voltage."

Gigapolis, a floating city teeming with four quadrillion souls, is a chaotic crucible where desire and technology collide. Amid the cold light of corporate domination that suffocates its citizens, Layla stands as a lone vigilante, a symbol of hope for the oppressed. Yet her fight is not merely one of violence or destruction. Deep within her heart burns empathy for those struggling at the city’s fringes, especially those with physical or mental disabilities, cast aside by society. Their plight fuels her actions.

### **Layla’s Other Battlefield**

One day, Layla visited "Oasis House," a support facility for the disabled in the lower districts of Gigapolis. This haven sheltered those unable to afford the costly cybernetic treatments or enhancements peddled by corporations. Within its worn walls lived people reliant on wheelchairs or assistive devices, those with visual or auditory impairments, and others bearing deep emotional scars. Far from the city’s neon glow, the place felt like a quiet island detached from Gigapolis’s clamor.

The moment Layla appeared at the entrance, a stir rippled through the residents. Her signature pink twin-tails and white leotard, accented by a red cape, instantly brightened the dim lobby. Children’s eyes sparkled, and adults gazed at her with a mix of awe and anticipation.

“Pink Voltage! It’s really her!”  
A boy in a wheelchair, Takeru, shouted in excitement. Layla flashed him a warm smile and glided toward him, her boots’ nanofibers faintly glowing as if she were skating across the floor. Kneeling before him, she gently placed her blue-gloved hand over his.

“What’s your name, kid?”  
Her voice was kind yet commanding. Takeru, a bit shy, answered, “Takeru.”  
“Takeru, today’s a special day. You ready?”  
With a wink, she ignited the room with energy.

### **The Show of the Body: A Festival of Strength and Beauty**

Layla had organized a “performance show” at Oasis House, leveraging her cybernetic abilities. This was no mere spectacle. Her goal was to inspire those with disabilities to recognize their own potential and awaken the strength to live freely, unbound by society’s constraints.

A simple stage was set up in the facility’s courtyard, where residents gathered. Layla stood at the center, her voice resonating without a microphone, amplified by an embedded audio device that carried her words clearly across the space.

“People of Gigapolis! Every one of you here has the power to overcome any challenge. I’m proof of that!”  
Her words held the crowd in rapt silence. With a flourish of her cape, she spun gracefully, her enhanced muscles moving fluidly beneath her leotard.

The show began. Layla first showcased her nanofiber-enhanced boots, stomping lightly to propel herself over ten meters into the air, executing a dazzling somersault. The crowd erupted in cheers. Next, she activated the micro-motors in her gloves, lifting a massive metal block as if it were paper and tossing it skyward. Before it could crash, she darted forward and caught it single-handedly, her movements defying time itself.

The true climax came when Layla involved the audience. Stepping off the stage, she invited Takeru and other residents to join her.  
“Strength isn’t in your body or appearance—it’s in your heart. Want to give it a try?”  

She handed Takeru a small device, a simplified version of her glove’s strength-augmenting technology. Skeptical but curious, Takeru followed her instructions and moved his arm. To his shock, he lifted a lightweight block with ease.  
“I did it! I really did it!” His trembling voice sparked applause from the crowd.

Layla continued, letting others try the devices or using her abilities to lift them gently into the air. For a visually impaired woman, she provided VR goggles with audio guidance to “feel” her movements. For a deaf man, she offered a device that transmitted music through vibrations, dancing with him to the rhythm. Her show was more than entertainment—it was a space for everyone to feel, “I can do this too.”

### **Welfare in Action: Rebooting Hearts**

After the show, Layla spent time with the residents, listening to their stories. An elderly man tearfully recounted losing his family to corporate exploitation; Layla held his hand in silence. A young woman who’d lost her legs in an accident shared her dream of walking again. Layla responded,  
“I was once just human, too. But I never gave up. I’m here now because I took that first step. You can, too.”

Layla donated medical cybernetic devices she’d acquired through backchannels, bypassing the corporations’ monopoly to provide them for free. Working with the facility’s staff, she planned rehabilitation programs and technical training, leveraging her knowledge and network to pave paths toward independence for the residents.

### **Pink Thunder Echoing in the Night Sky**

As night deepened and Layla prepared to leave Oasis House, the residents gathered in the courtyard to see her off. Takeru wheeled forward and said,  
“Layla, I want to be strong like you.”  
She smiled, gently ruffling his hair.  
“Takeru, you’re already strong. You just need to believe it.”

With a flourish of her cape, she activated her boots’ jets, her pink hair fluttering in the night breeze as she vanished into the sky. Behind her, Gigapolis’s neon flickered, as if her presence had shaken the city’s very systems.

The residents of Oasis House gazed upward, clutching the spark of hope she’d left in their hearts. Pink Voltage’s fight was more than a battle for justice—it was a story of rebooting, of inspiring everyone to believe in their own strength and rise again.

And somewhere in Gigapolis, Layla sped toward her next battlefield, her heart unwavering in its resolve to save all those oppressed.

### **The Neon Colosseum**

At the heart of Gigapolis, the Colosseum stood bathed in a flood of neon, pulsing as if the night sky itself were alive with fervor. In this floating city of four quadrillion souls, tonight’s star was unmistakably Layla Virel Nova, Pink Voltage. The packed stands overflowed with spectators eager to catch a glimpse of her, their eyes swirling with excitement and anticipation for her overwhelming charisma.

A spotlight ignited in the center of the massive circular arena, revealing Layla. Her pink twin-tails glowed like plasma under the neon’s glare. Her white leotard clung to her like a second skin, accentuating her voluptuous curves—full chest, toned waist, and graceful legs. Her red cape fluttered, and her blue gloves and boots hummed faintly with mechanical energy. Swaying her hips lightly, she flashed a provocative smile and winked at the crowd. The arena exploded with cheers and whistles.

“Pink Voltage! Kick some ass!”  
“God, that body’s unreal!”  
The crowd’s shouts merged into a fevered roar, the Colosseum trembling with their passion. Layla bit her lip, her smile sultry yet edged with a warrior’s sharpness, as she soaked in the adulation.

A heavy thud echoed from the opposite side of the arena as her opponent emerged: a massive cybernetic bear, “Iron Claw `'Claw.” Standing over three meters tall, its steel-and-nanofiber body and glowing red eyes sent shivers through the crowd. Yet Layla remained unfazed. One hand on her hip, she looked up at the bear with a taunting grin.

“Hey, big guy, bold move challenging me on a night like this.”  
Her voice was sweet but laced with danger. Iron Claw roared and charged, shaking the ground. The crowd held its breath, but Layla dodged with dancer-like grace, her cape swirling as her leotard gleamed. The audience was mesmerized by her every move.

The fight was like a game to Layla. As Iron Claw swung its massive claws, she leaped and slid along them, flipping through the air with a sway of her curves that drew gasps. Landing behind the bear, she activated her boots’ jets, darting back with ease.  
“Can’t you move faster, big guy? You’re slowing me down!”  
She laughed, her hips swaying provocatively, driving the crowd wild.

Iron Claw charged in fury, but Layla was ready. Her gloves’ micro-motors flared, and her glowing fist smashed into the bear’s chest, sending shockwaves through the arena. She danced around the beast, her lithe legs delivering a spinning kick to its frame, her leotard emphasizing every curve. The crowd roared, captivated by her beauty and power.

Sensing the moment, Layla ended it. She darted behind Iron Claw, her gloves at maximum power, and struck its core with a crackling punch. Sparks flew as the bear collapsed, system offline. The Colosseum erupted in triumphant cheers.

Layla stood over her fallen foe, her sweat-glistened skin catching the light, her leotard accentuating her form. She struck a slow, deliberate pose, her chest rising and falling, and waved to the crowd with a seductive smile before striding off the stage. The neon flickered behind her, as if her presence had rattled the city’s core.

The audience stood, chanting her name. Layla Virel Nova, Pink Voltage—a warrior, a temptress, and the unchallenged ruler of Gigapolis’s night.

The Gigapolis Colosseum, still buzzing from the first match, was swept into a new wave of fervor. As neon lights refracted across the arena, the crowd’s attention locked onto the stage. When the announcer revealed the opponent for the second match, a hush fell, quickly replaced by a mix of curious murmurs and mocking laughter. Layla Virel Nova, Pink Voltage, would face “Ahegao Master Jiro”—a name that drew chuckles from half the audience and unsettling anticipation from the other half.

Jiro stepped into the arena. His gaunt frame, disheveled hair, and tattered black robe made him look more like a back-alley drifter than a Colosseum warrior. But those who knew his reputation weren’t fooled. Jiro wielded a bizarre power: the ability to shatter his opponent’s psyche, twisting their face into an expression of extreme shame and pleasure—the infamous “ahegao.” In his hand, a strange device pulsed with faint green light, rumored to be the source of his “Shame Assault.”

Layla stood at the center of the stage, her pink twin-tails swaying lightly, her cool gaze fixed on Jiro. Her white leotard hugged her voluptuous curves, her red cape fluttering faintly. A confident smile played on her lips.  
“So, you’re Jiro? You think a scrawny guy like you can take me down?”  
She placed a hand on her hip, deliberately accentuating her chest in a provocative taunt. Whistles and cheers erupted from the stands. Her voice was sweet but carried a razor-sharp edge.  
“Ahegao? Please, that childish trick won’t work on me. Come on, bring it!”  
She snapped her blue gloves, settling into a fighting stance, her confidence electrifying the arena.

Jiro grinned, his thin fingers toying with the device as he took a step forward.  
“Pink Voltage, I can’t wait to see how that pretty face of yours twists…”  
His low, slimy voice dripped with eerie menace.

The gong sounded, signaling the start of the match. Layla moved with her signature agility, activating her boots’ jets to close the distance in a flash. Her fist sliced through the air, aiming for Jiro’s face. But Jiro dodged with surprising speed, pointing his device at her. A green light enveloped Layla, sending strange vibrations through her nervous system.

“What…!?”  
Layla’s cool expression faltered for a moment. Her body trembled slightly, a sweet, numbing sensation flooding her mind. Jiro’s “Shame Assault” targeted her cybernetic nervous system, forcibly inducing feelings of pleasure and humiliation. Gritting her teeth, Layla leaped back to shake it off, but Jiro relentlessly kept the device trained on her.

“Come on, Pink Voltage! Feel it!”  
Jiro’s mocking laughter echoed as Layla’s face began to change. Her eyes grew misty, her lips trembled, her cheeks flushed red. The crowd gasped. Layla’s beautiful face contorted, overwhelmed by uncontrollable pleasure and shame, revealing the dreaded ahegao. Her mouth hung half-open, her eyes glazed, her pink twin-tails disheveled. Her voluptuous chest, clad in the tight leotard, heaved wildly, sending the audience into a frenzy.

“Pink Voltage… she’s done for!”  
“That face! It’s insane!”  
The crowd’s shouts shook the Colosseum, amplifying Layla’s humiliation. Her movements slowed, her attacks losing their usual precision. Jiro, wearing a smug grin, approached with the device in hand.  
“Show me more, Pink Voltage. That face is the ultimate show!”  

But Layla’s spirit remained unbroken. Biting her lip, her eyes flashed with defiance as she forcibly regained control.  
“You… pervert…! You think this will stop me…!?”  
With a shout, she overrode her cybernetic systems, activating a neural defense program to block Jiro’s attack. The green light shattered, and Layla’s face snapped back to its cool, composed state. As the crowd held its breath, she flipped her cape and charged at Jiro with blazing speed.

“Playtime’s over, Jiro!”  
Her gloves glowed, nanofiber power at full throttle. Her fist smashed Jiro’s device into fragments. Without pausing, she ignited her boots’ jets, spinning in the air to deliver a devastating kick to Jiro’s stomach. He flew back, crashing into the Colosseum wall and collapsing, unconscious.

Layla landed in the arena’s center, her sweat-glistened skin catching the light as she rose slowly, her leotard emphasizing her curves. Her pink hair swayed in the breeze. With a provocative smile, she called out to the stands:  
“Who’s next? Anyone think they can stop Pink Voltage?”  

The Colosseum erupted in thunderous cheers. Overcoming a fleeting moment of shame, Layla carved another legend into Gigapolis’s history. Her battle proved she could transcend any obstacle—shame, pleasure, or otherwise. Beneath the flickering neon sky, Pink Voltage reigned supreme once more.

The Gigapolis Colosseum, still reverberating from the second match’s intensity, was bathed in neon flashes signaling the start of the third. The packed stands buzzed with anticipation for Pink Voltage, Layla Virel Nova’s next fight. A spotlight sliced through the arena, revealing Layla once more. Her pink twin-tails glowed like plasma, her white leotard accentuating her voluptuous curves. Her red cape swayed, and her blue gloves and boots hummed faintly. With a cool smile, she stood at the center, basking in the crowd’s cheers.

But when her opponent appeared, a shocked murmur rippled through the Colosseum. The challenger was a woman dressed in an outfit identical to Layla’s: white leotard, red cape, blue gloves, and boots—a perfect replica of Pink Voltage’s iconic look. The only difference was her hair: a sleek black ponytail that swayed with an air of Eastern elegance. Her name was Kuroha Satsuki, an ardent fan of Layla who had trained relentlessly to surpass her idol.

Satsuki stepped onto the stage, her eyes blazing with admiration and determination as she faced Layla.  
“Pink Voltage… Layla! I’ve come this far because I admire everything about you. But today, I’ll defeat you and become the new legend!”  
Her voice was strong, tinged with respect. Her leotard, like Layla’s, highlighted her full chest and toned waist, captivating the crowd. Yet her movements carried the fluid precision of Eastern martial arts.

Layla placed a hand on her hip, tossing her pink hair with a measuring smile.  
“Not bad taste, copying my outfit. But you know, don’t you? Beating me isn’t that easy.”  
Her voice was sweet and taunting, sparking whistles and cheers as the Colosseum heated up.

The gong rang. Satsuki moved instantly, her steps flowing like water, rooted in Eastern martial arts as she closed in on Layla. Layla activated her boots’ jets, dodging lightly, but Satsuki’s attacks were sharper than expected. Satsuki unleashed a palm strike aimed at Layla’s midsection. Layla blocked with her gloves, but Satsuki dropped low in a flash, landing a sharp kick to Layla’s thigh.

“Not bad!”  
Layla kept her smile, counterattacking with a glowing nanofiber-powered punch. But Satsuki deftly redirected it, her movements reminiscent of tai chi, deflecting Layla’s force. Then came Satsuki’s true weapon: the “Sensual Zone Strike.” Reading Layla’s movements, Satsuki slid her fingers across Layla’s chest, targeting her cybernetic nervous system with a pressure technique that sent waves of stimulation.

Layla’s body trembled, her cheeks faintly flushing.  
“This… technique…!”  
Satsuki’s attack hypersensitized Layla’s nerves, inducing pleasure and disarray. The crowd roared as Layla’s leotard-clad chest swayed, her every movement amplifying their frenzy. Satsuki pressed her advantage, placing a palm on Layla’s waist to send more stimulation. A soft gasp escaped Layla’s lips, her pink twin-tails falling into disarray.

“Layla, you look amazing… but I’m the one on top!”  
Satsuki shouted, her ponytail swaying as she targeted Layla’s faltering moments with relentless strikes. Her kicks were precise, blending sensual stimulation with pain, targeting Layla’s thighs and abdomen. Layla’s sweat-glistened leotard highlighted her curves, driving the crowd wild.

But Layla was Pink Voltage. Her eyes flashed, her inner resolve reigniting.  
“Satsuki, nice moves. But playtime’s over!”  
She fully activated her cybernetic systems, blocking Satsuki’s stimulation. Her gloves glowed blue, nanofibers at maximum power. As Satsuki launched another strike, Layla closed the distance in an instant, landing a powerful punch to Satsuki’s stomach. Satsuki staggered but Layla pressed on, igniting her boots’ jets to spin in the air and deliver a kick to Satsuki’s shoulder.

Satsuki didn’t fall. Gritting her teeth, she stood, her sweat-soaked ponytail clinging to her, her leotard taut.  
“It’s not… over…! Layla, I’ll beat you…!”  
She lunged, aiming another sensual strike at Layla’s chest. But Layla was unshaken. Grabbing Satsuki’s wrist, she used her momentum to throw her. Just before Satsuki hit the ground, Layla darted forward, catching her gently.

“Satsuki, you’re strong. Thank you for being my fan.”  
Layla smiled, lowering Satsuki to the ground. Satsuki, breathless and frustrated, looked up at her with respect in her eyes.  
“Layla… next time… I’ll…”  
She collapsed, exhausted.

The Colosseum roared with deafening cheers. Layla rose, her sweat-glistened skin gleaming, her leotard accentuating her curves as her pink hair flowed.  
“Gigapolis! Pink Voltage isn’t stopping yet! Who’s next!?”  

The crowd chanted her name under the flickering neon sky, Layla’s victory etched into history. Satsuki’s challenge had sparked a small flame in Layla’s heart. She wasn’t just a warrior—she carried the dreams of others. That truth burned brighter within her.

The Gigapolis Colosseum roared with anticipation under neon lights as the fourth match loomed. The stands overflowed with spectators eager for Layla Virel Nova, Pink Voltage, to dazzle again. At center stage, her pink twin-tails glowed like plasma, her white leotard accentuating her voluptuous curves, red cape swaying, and blue gloves and boots humming faintly. She flashed a provocative smile, igniting cheers.

The arena hushed as her opponent emerged: Mirage, a slime-like female monster. Her translucent, fluid body shimmered with eerie green light, blending feminine curves with otherworldly allure. A fervent fan of Layla, Mirage harbored a fetishistic desire to “futanarize” her and revel in her moans. The crowd buzzed with curiosity as Mirage leered, licking her lips.

“Pink Voltage… I’ll transform that gorgeous body into something even more exquisite…”  
Her voice was sweet yet viscous. Layla raised an eyebrow, her gaze cool.  
“Freaky taste, huh? Staring at my body like that? Get ready for a reckoning.”  
Swaying her hips, her leotard gleamed, sparking cheers.

The gong rang. Mirage liquefied, sliding across the stage toward Layla, who dodged with a jet-powered leap. But Mirage’s movements were erratic. Her slime arm stretched, snaring Layla’s ankle.  
“What!?”  
Before Layla could react, Mirage yanked her into the air, swinging her around. Layla’s twin-tails and cape arced, her leotard taut, captivating the crowd.

Mirage dangled Layla upside-down, eyeing her crotch.  
“Such a perfect body… I’ll make it extraordinary!”  
Slime tendrils extended, wrapping Layla’s leotard at the groin, secreting chemicals to “futanarize” her via her cybernetic nerves. The crowd roared as Layla’s face twitched, a soft moan escaping, cheeks flushing.  
“Damn… you…!”  

But Layla was Pink Voltage. Her eyes blazed, overriding her systems, nanofibers at full power. She tore free, flipping midair to land gracefully. As the crowd cheered, she glared at Mirage.  
“Enough! That trick won’t work!”  

Mirage persisted, liquefying to pin Layla’s feet, immobilizing her.  
“Not yet, Layla… feel it!”  
New tendrils formed a serrated “tongue-saw,” targeting Layla’s clitoris with precise vibrations. Layla shuddered, a stifled moan breaking free.  
“Ngh… ah… damn it…!”  
Her chest heaved, sweat-soaked leotard clinging tighter, driving the crowd wild.

Yet Layla’s resolve held. Gritting her teeth, she countered the stimulation.  
“You think… this’ll break me!?”  
Her gloves surged, slamming the ground to loosen Mirage’s grip. Leaping free, she spun midair, jets flaring, and delivered a crushing kick, scattering Mirage’s form. As Mirage tried to reform, Layla unleashed electric shocks from her gloves, hardening the slime and landing a final blow to silence her.

Breathing heavily, Layla rose, her glistening skin and leotard accentuating her curves, pink hair radiant. With a taunting smile, she shouted:  
“Gigapolis! No one stops Pink Voltage! Who’s next!?”  

The Colosseum exploded in cheers, Layla’s triumph over Mirage’s fetishistic assault cementing her legend under the flickering neon sky.

---

Beneath Gigapolis’s twinkling neon, the Colosseum’s fervor spilled into the city, Layla’s “defeat scenes” sparking a cultural and economic boom. Her fleeting vulnerabilities—her ahegao against Jiro, enduring Mirage’s tongue-saw—captivated fans, fueling a merchandising frenzy.
