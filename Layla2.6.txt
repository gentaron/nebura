### **Layla’s Embarrassing Mishap**

Amid the relentless assault of the tongue-saw, Layla’s body convulsed under the overpowering pleasure, and in a moment of involuntary surrender, she let out an audible fart. The sound, though brief, cut through the plaza’s obscene ambiance, a humiliating lapse that betrayed her cybernetic control. Layla’s face, already contorted in ahegao, flushed with a fleeting spark of shame, but the sigils’ pulsing glow and the saw’s torment quickly drowned it out.

The female teacher’s eyes gleamed with sadistic glee, catching the mishap instantly. “Oh, Pink Voltage, how unbecoming!” she mocked, twirling her pointer. With a snap of her fingers, purple mist coalesced into a sleek, floating camera positioned to capture Layla’s buttocks from an invasive angle. A massive holographic screen materialized above the plaza, projecting a high-definition view of her sweat-slicked, trembling rear, the pink sigil glowing prominently. The tongue-saw’s rhythmic hits caused her buttock flesh to quiver enticingly, each tremor magnified on the screen for Ken, Rina, and the unseen audience of the monstrous slime’s design. The teacher cackled, “Look, your hero’s disgrace, broadcast for all to see!”

### **The Perverse Leech**

The teacher’s cruelty escalated. From the purple mist, she summoned a grotesque, 3-centimeter-long leech-like creature, its translucent body lined with tiny, needle-like teeth. With deliberate precision, she pressed it onto Layla’s right nipple, where the dissolved leotard already exposed her areola. The leech latched on, its teeth grazing the sensitive flesh with a perverse nibble. Layla’s body jolted, a muffled moan escaping her ahegao lips as the leech’s touch sent a new wave of sensation through her overloaded nerves. The teacher smirked, “This little darling will make your shame even sweeter, Pink Voltage.”

The leech, pulsating with the slime’s energy, began to secrete a small amount of costume-dissolving fluid from its mouth. The fluid pooled around Layla’s nipple, further eroding the leotard’s remnants until the tender bud was fully exposed, glistening under the neon lights. The leech’s tiny teeth nibbled gently, alternating between soft sucks and sharp grazes, intensifying Layla’s torment. Her right breast quivered, the sigil on her left lower breast pulsing in sync with her escalating distress.

### **The Teacher’s Mocking Song and Playful Torments**

As Layla writhed, the female teacher began to sing a twisted parody of a heroic anthem, her voice dripping with sarcasm. The lyrics celebrated Layla’s “fall” into depravity, mocking her as the “queen of ahegao” and the “slave of the tongue-saw.” Each verse highlighted her exposed body, her trembling buttocks, and her nipple’s torment, turning her heroic legacy into a perverse spectacle. The song echoed through the plaza, a cruel counterpoint to Layla’s moans.

Bored with mere taunts, the teacher indulged in idle, degrading play. She conjured a pair of oversized glasses from the mist and placed them on Layla’s ahegao face, the lenses magnifying her rolled-back eyes and drooling mouth. “There, a scholar of submission!” she jeered. Next, she produced a glowing marker and began doodling on Layla’s thighs, sketching crude hearts and mocking phrases like “Voltage Slave” and “Clit Queen.” The neon ink glowed against her sweat-soaked skin, adding to her humiliation. Layla’s body, locked in place, could only tremble under these indignities.

### **Real-Time Hit Counter**

The teacher’s sadism extended to the holographic screen. With a wave of her pointer, a digital counter appeared, displaying the number of times the tongue-saw’s protrusions struck Layla’s clitoris in real time. The numbers ticked upward steadily—1,237… 1,238… 1,239—each hit accompanied by a wet, obscene sound and a visible quiver of Layla’s groin on the screen. The teacher narrated gleefully, “See, Ken, Rina? Every strike breaks her further. She’s not fighting—she’s surrendering to each delicious hit!”

Layla’s clitoris, outlined starkly by the tattered leotard, danced helplessly under the saw’s slow, deliberate assault. The lotion ensured each protrusion’s touch was slick and invasive, and the morphing textures—smooth, ridged, pulsating—kept her nerves in constant chaos. Her ahegao deepened, her voice reduced to incoherent gasps, unable to form words under the overwhelming pleasure.

### **The Teacher’s Claim of Surrender**

The female teacher leaned in, her glasses glinting as she addressed Layla directly. “You’re not resisting anymore, are you, Pink Voltage? You’re giving yourself to the tongue-saw’s embrace!” She gestured to the slime restraints locking Layla’s legs. “These aren’t chains—they’re just propping you up so you can savor every moment. Your body’s begging for this!”  

Layla’s moans grew louder, her cybernetic systems flickering but unable to break free. The sigils pulsed, the leech nibbled, and the tongue-saw’s counter climbed—1,250… 1,251. Her buttocks, projected on the screen, quivered with each hit, the pink sigil a mocking emblem of her plight.

### **Ken and Rina’s Despair and Defiance**

Ken and Rina, trapped in their slime cage, watched the depraved spectacle with mounting despair. Layla’s fart, her buttocks on display, the leech on her nipple, and the teacher’s cruel song crushed their spirits. Ken’s earlier fascination had turned to horror, his fists pounding the cage’s walls. “Layla, don’t give up! You’re Pink Voltage! You can beat this!” His voice cracked, guilt and fear mingling with his resolve.

Rina, tears streaming down her face, clung to Ken’s hand. “Layla, you’re stronger than this! We know you’re still fighting!” Her voice trembled, the sight of Layla’s ahegao and the counter’s relentless ticking fueling her desperation. The perverse beauty of Layla’s torment stirred conflicting emotions, but their faith in her refused to waver.

### **Layla’s Tormented State**

Layla’s body was a battlefield of forced pleasure and fading defiance. The tongue-saw’s protrusions, the leech’s nibbling, the sigils’ pulsing, and the teacher’s degradations overwhelmed her cybernetic defenses. Her clitoris, starkly outlined, quivered with each hit, the lotion amplifying every sensation. Her ahegao face, now adorned with mocking glasses, and her doodled thighs marked her as a caricature of her heroic self. Yet, deep within, a spark of resistance flickered, her gloves glowing faintly as her cybernetic systems strained against the slime’s control.

### **The Plaza’s Escalating Nightmare**

The neon-lit plaza of Gigapolis remained a stage for Layla’s torment. The holographic screen, the hit counter, the teacher’s song, and the leech’s perverse nibbling created a grotesque spectacle. Ken and Rina’s cheers, though desperate, were drowned by the teacher’s cruelty and Layla’s moans. The air warped with the threat of further monstrous escalation, but Layla’s faint glow and the bond with Ken and Rina hinted at a possible turning point. The battle for Layla’s spirit and their freedom teetered on the edge, with the neon lights flickering ominously.

The neon-lit plaza of Gigapolis pulsed with an oppressive mix of flickering lights and swirling purple mist, a stage for the grotesque spectacle orchestrated by the monstrous slime. Pink Voltage, Layla Virell Nova, stood locked in a telekinetic hold, her body forced into a humiliating squat with legs spread wide, hands pinned to her hips. Her white leotard, ravaged by costume-dissolving cream, clung desperately to her voluptuous curves, with pink sigils of submission glowing on her right buttock and left lower breast. A perverse leech nibbled at her exposed right nipple, and her clitoris, barely concealed by a tattered strip of fabric, quivered from the recent torment of the spinning tongue-saw. Layla’s ahegao expression—tongue lolling, drool dripping, eyes rolled upward—was framed by oversized glasses placed mockingly on her face, with neon doodles defacing her thighs. Ken and Rina, trapped in a deformed, metallic slime cage, gripped each other’s hands, their cheers for Layla drowned by despair and the female teacher’s sadistic taunts. The teacher, a manifestation of the monstrous slime, twirled her pointer with cruel delight, her glasses glinting as she reveled in Layla’s degradation.

### **The Tongue-Saw Stops and New Torment Begins**

Abruptly, the female teacher raised her pointer, and the spinning tongue-saw halted, its wet, obscene sounds fading into the plaza’s eerie silence. Layla’s body shuddered, the sudden cessation of stimulation leaving her trembling. The teacher stepped closer, her smirk widening as she extended a tendril of purple slime from her hand. The slime, soft and pliable, slithered toward Layla’s groin, enveloping her clitoris with a gentle, deliberate touch. It kneaded the sensitive bud slowly, each motion sending waves of forced pleasure through Layla’s cybernetic nervous system. Her ahegao deepened, her moans growing softer but no less desperate, as the slime’s caress replaced the saw’s brutal assault with a more insidious torment.

The teacher’s voice dripped with mockery. “Feel that, Pink Voltage? So much better when it’s slow and tender, isn’t it? Your body’s begging for it now.” Layla’s lips quivered, unable to form words, her eyes flickering with a mix of defiance and involuntary submission.

### **The Third Sigil of Submission**

With a flourish of her pointer, the teacher summoned a new wave of purple mist. The mist coalesced above Layla’s groin, where the tattered leotard barely concealed her clitoris. A miniature pink sigil of submission, no larger than a coin, materialized and adhered to the thin fabric, glowing faintly against the exposed contours of her clitoris. The sigil pulsed in sync with the others, its tiny size belying its power. Layla’s body jolted, a muffled gasp escaping her lips as the third sigil tightened the slime’s hold over her.

The teacher turned to Ken and Rina, her glasses glinting with triumph. “It’s done! The contract of submission is complete. Three sigils—her hip, her breast, and now her most sensitive core. Pink Voltage is ours, and you, Ken, Rina, made this possible. Thank you for delivering her to us!” Her laughter echoed, a cruel taunt that pierced the trapped duo’s hearts.

### **Ken’s Disbelief and Questioning**

Ken, his mind freed from the monstrous Layla’s hypnosis, stared in horror at the glowing sigil on Layla’s groin. The teacher’s words and Layla’s tormented state shook him to his core. He pounded on the slime cage, his voice raw with disbelief and desperation. “Layla, no! This isn’t you! You’re Pink Voltage! You can’t be… theirs! Fight it, please!” His eyes searched hers, pleading for a sign of her unyielding spirit.

Rina, tears streaming down her face, gripped Ken’s hand tightly. “Layla, you’re stronger than this! Don’t let them win!” Their voices, though filled with despair, carried a flicker of hope, a desperate call to the hero they believed in.

Layla’s ahegao face wavered, her cybernetic systems flickering faintly. Her gloves glowed blue, a sign of her struggling defiance, but the three sigils pulsed in unison, suppressing her resistance. She could only moan softly, her body still quivering from the slime’s caress.

### **Layla’s Release and Submission**

The female teacher, satisfied with her victory, waved her pointer, and the telekinetic lock on Layla dissolved. The slime restraints binding her legs melted away, and she stumbled forward, free but marked by the sigils’ control. The teacher’s voice turned commanding, directed at Layla. “Now, Pink Voltage, show your masters your submission. Turn around and present your ass to Ken and Rina!”

Layla’s body moved as if compelled, her cybernetic systems overridden by the sigils’ power. She turned slowly, her sweat-soaked twintails swaying, and bent forward, presenting her buttocks. The pink sigil on her right buttock glowed brightly, the dissolved leotard exposing her trembling flesh. The holographic screen above the plaza zoomed in, magnifying the humiliating display, with her quivering buttocks and the faint outline of her clitoris still visible under the tattered fabric. The leech on her nipple continued its perverse nibbling, adding to her degradation.

### **Ken and Rina’s Despair**

Ken and Rina, trapped in their slime cage, watched in abject horror as Layla complied with the teacher’s command. The sight of their hero, reduced to this submissive act, crushed their spirits. Ken’s fists clenched, his voice breaking. “Layla… no… this can’t be real…!” Guilt and despair overwhelmed him, the memory of his earlier fascination now a bitter weight.

Rina’s tears flowed freely, her voice a desperate whisper. “Layla… we’re sorry… we believe in you… please, come back to us…” Their hands remained clasped, their faith in Layla teetering on the edge of collapse, yet clinging to the hope that her spirit could still prevail.

### **The Teacher’s Gloating**

The female teacher circled Layla, her pointer tapping the air near her exposed buttocks. “Look at your hero now, Ken, Rina! Pink Voltage, the pride of Gigapolis, reduced to our obedient pet. These sigils bind her body and soul. She’s ours, forever!” She gestured to the holographic screen, where the counter of the tongue-saw’s hits remained frozen at 1,289, a testament to Layla’s torment. The leech on her nipple pulsed, its nibbling relentless, and the miniature sigil on her groin glowed with an eerie permanence.

Layla’s body trembled, her ahegao expression softening into a vacant stare. The slime’s caress had ceased, but the sigils’ influence held her in thrall. Her gloves flickered faintly, a sign of her cybernetic systems struggling, but the three sigils pulsed stronger, drowning out her resistance.

### **The Plaza’s Crushing Atmosphere**

The neon-lit plaza of Gigapolis was a crucible of despair and degradation. Layla’s submissive pose, her buttocks presented under the glowing sigil, and the holographic screen’s invasive display painted a grim picture. The female teacher’s triumphant laughter, the leech’s perverse nibbling, and the sigils’ unyielding control dominated the scene. Ken and Rina, trapped in their cage, grappled with the crushing weight of their failure to save Layla, their cheers now hollow against the monstrous slime’s victory. Yet, the faint blue glow of Layla’s gloves hinted at a lingering spark of defiance, a sliver of hope in the face of overwhelming darkness. The air warped with the threat of further torment, as the battle for Layla’s soul and their freedom hung in a precarious, heart-wrenching balance.

The neon-lit plaza of Gigapolis was a nightmarish tableau, suffused with the flickering glow of neon lights and swirling purple mist that pulsed with malevolent energy. Pink Voltage, Layla Virell Nova, stood in a degrading squat, her legs spread wide and hands pinned to her hips by the monstrous slime’s telekinetic grip. Her white leotard, ravaged by costume-dissolving cream, barely clung to her voluptuous curves, with pink sigils of submission glowing on her right buttock, left lower breast, and now a miniature sigil on the tattered fabric over her clitoris. A perverse leech nibbled relentlessly at her exposed right nipple, and her ahegao expression—tongue lolling, drool dripping, eyes rolled upward—was framed by mocking oversized glasses and neon doodles defacing her thighs. Ken and Rina, trapped in a deformed, metallic slime cage, clung to each other, their despair deepening as Layla’s degradation reached new lows. The female teacher, a sadistic manifestation of the monstrous slime, twirled her pointer with cruel delight, her glasses glinting as she orchestrated the perverse spectacle.

### **Layla’s Shocking Plea**

Under the oppressive influence of the three sigils, Layla’s body trembled, her cybernetic systems overwhelmed by the relentless torment. The faint blue glow of her gloves flickered, a sign of her fading resistance, but the sigils’ pulsing power dominated her will. In a shocking twist, Layla’s lips parted, and her voice, manipulated by the slime’s control, emerged in a desperate, pleading tone.  
“Please… Teacher… let the leech bite my clitoris…”  
Her words, laced with forced submission, stunned Ken and Rina. Layla’s ahegao face quivered, her eyes vacant yet glistening with a mix of shame and coerced desire, as the sigils compelled her to beg for further degradation.

The female teacher’s face lit up with sadistic glee. “Oh, Pink Voltage, how delightful! Begging for your own ruin? I’ll indulge you!” With a flourish of her pointer, she summoned a new creature from the purple mist—a 1-centimeter-long, transparent leech, its worm-like mouth bristling with countless microscopic teeth. The teacher knelt before Layla’s spread legs, her glasses glinting as she carefully placed the leech onto the tattered fabric barely concealing Layla’s clitoris. The creature latched on instantly, its tiny teeth grazing the sensitive bud through the thin material. Layla’s body convulsed, a guttural moan escaping her lips as the leech’s microscopic bites sent sharp, electrified sensations through her nerves.

### **The Leech’s Perverse Dance**

The transparent leech moved with a grotesque, dance-like rhythm, its worm-like mouth writhing as it nibbled and sucked at Layla’s clitoris. The microscopic teeth, though tiny, delivered precise, pulsating bites, each one a unique torment that amplified the sigil’s control. The leech’s translucent body revealed its inner workings, the faint glow of the miniature sigil pulsing in sync with its movements. Layla’s hips twitched involuntarily, her ahegao deepening as drool dripped from her chin. The leotard’s remnants stretched taut, outlining her clitoris’s quivering shape with obscene clarity.

Ken and Rina, trapped in their slime cage, watched in horrified fascination as the leech performed its perverse dance. Ken’s face paled, his earlier guilt now a crushing weight. “Layla… no… you can’t want this!” he whispered, his voice breaking. Rina’s eyes widened, tears streaming as she gripped Ken’s hand. “She’s still in there… she has to be…” Their words were barely audible, drowned by the teacher’s mocking laughter and Layla’s moans.

### **The Screens’ Invasive Replay**

The female teacher snapped her fingers, and the plaza erupted with a dozen holographic screens, each floating at different angles to maximize the spectacle. The screens began playing close-up replays of Layla’s earlier torment under the tongue-saw, the footage rendered in excruciating detail. Slow-motion shots zoomed in on her clitoris, the tongue-like protrusions flicking and pulsing against the tattered leotard, each hit highlighting the bud’s sensitive contours. Other screens displayed Layla’s ahegao face in high definition—her rolled-back eyes, lolling tongue, and drooling lips captured in humiliating clarity. Some replays looped her involuntary fart, her quivering buttocks magnified for all to see, while others focused on the leech nibbling her nipple.

The teacher narrated with sadistic enthusiasm. “Look, Ken, Rina! Relive every moment of Pink Voltage’s fall! See how her clitoris danced under the tongue-saw, how her pride crumbled with each hit! 1,289 strikes, and now this leech—her own request!” The screens flickered, some showing slow-motion replays of the saw’s protrusions, others zooming in on Layla’s current torment as the leech’s microscopic teeth grazed her clitoris.

### **Layla’s Overwhelmed State**

Layla’s body convulsed under the leech’s relentless nibbling, her clitoris quivering helplessly under the tattered fabric. The sigils pulsed in unison, their pink glow intensifying the forced pleasure. Her ahegao deepened, her moans incoherent, her cybernetic systems flickering but unable to resist. The teacher’s earlier claim rang true—Layla’s body seemed to surrender to the leech’s torment, her legs trembling in their slime restraints, which now served only to prop her up. Her gloves glowed faintly, a sign of her struggling spirit, but the leech’s microscopic bites and the sigils’ control overwhelmed her.

The teacher leaned in, her pointer tapping Layla’s thigh. “You’re loving this, aren’t you, Pink Voltage? Your body’s given up—look at that clitoris, dancing for the leech!” Layla could only moan, her voice lost in the haze of ecstasy, her ahegao face a mockery of her heroic legacy.

### **Ken and Rina’s Despair**

Ken and Rina, confined in their cage, watched the screens’ invasive replays and the leech’s perverse dance with mounting despair. Layla’s plea for the leech had shattered their hope, leaving them grappling with the fear that she was truly lost. Ken pounded on the cage, his voice raw. “Layla, fight it! You’re Pink Voltage! You’re stronger than this!” His words carried desperation, his earlier fascination now replaced by guilt and terror.

Rina, tears streaming, clung to Ken’s hand. “Layla… please… you can’t be gone… we need you!” Her voice trembled, the sight of Layla’s ahegao, the leech’s writhing, and the screens’ relentless replays crushing her spirit. Yet, their faith in Layla’s resilience lingered, a faint spark amidst their despair.

### **The Teacher’s Triumph**

The female teacher reveled in her victory, twirling her pointer as the screens looped Layla’s torment. “It’s over, Ken, Rina. Pink Voltage is ours—body and soul. These sigils, this leech, her own plea—they’ve sealed her fate!” She gestured to the screens, where Layla’s clitoris and ahegao face dominated the view. The leech’s dance continued, its microscopic teeth nibbling with relentless precision, each bite pushing Layla deeper into submission.

Layla’s body trembled, her cybernetic glow dimming as the sigils pulsed. The plaza’s neon lights flickered, casting an eerie glow over the scene. The air warped with the threat of further monstrous escalation, but the faint flicker of Layla’s gloves and the desperate cheers of Ken and Rina hinted at a sliver of hope. The battle for Layla’s spirit and their freedom hung in a torturous, heart-wrenching balance, with the monstrous slime’s triumph looming large.

The neon-drenched plaza of Gigapolis was a crucible of despair, bathed in the flickering glow of neon lights and cloaked in swirling purple mist that pulsed with malevolent intent. Pink Voltage, Layla Virell Nova, stood ensnared in the monstrous slime’s telekinetic grip, her once-proud form reduced to a humiliating spectacle. Her white leotard, ravaged by costume-dissolving cream, clung precariously to her voluptuous curves, with pink sigils of submission glowing ominously on her right buttock, left lower breast, and a miniature sigil over her clitoris, barely concealed by tattered fabric. A grotesque leech nibbled at her exposed right nipple, while a transparent, 1-centimeter leech with microscopic teeth tormented her clitoris, its writhing dance amplifying her forced ecstasy. Layla’s ahegao expression—tongue lolling, drool dripping, eyes rolled upward—was framed by mocking oversized glasses, with neon doodles defacing her thighs. Multiple holographic screens loomed above, replaying her torment under the tongue-saw and leech in excruciating detail. Ken and Rina, trapped in a deformed, metallic slime cage, clung to each other, their cheers for Layla now silenced by crushing despair. The female teacher, a sadistic manifestation of the monstrous slime, twirled her pointer with cruel delight, her glasses glinting as she pushed Layla’s degradation to new depths.

### **Layla’s Forced Pose**

The female teacher’s smirk widened as she waved her pointer, channeling the slime’s telekinetic power. Layla’s body, already trembling from the leech’s relentless nibbling, was manipulated further. “Pink Voltage, let’s showcase your submission properly,” the teacher purred. The telekinetic grip forced Layla to shift, her legs unsteady as she was guided toward a low, slime-formed platform that materialized from the ground. She was compelled to bend forward, her hands gripping the platform’s edge for support, her hips thrust backward to present her buttocks. The pink sigil on her right buttock glowed brightly, the dissolved leotard exposing her sweat-slicked, trembling flesh. Her twintails swayed, and her ahegao face remained fixed, drool pooling beneath her as the leeches continued their perverse assault.

Layla’s posture was a grotesque parody of her heroic stance, her buttocks elevated and vulnerable under the neon glare. The holographic screens adjusted, zooming in on her rear, magnifying the quivering flesh and the glowing sigil for maximum humiliation. The teacher’s voice echoed with sadistic satisfaction. “There’s the hero of Gigapolis—reduced to this! Ken, Rina, feast your eyes on her disgrace!”
