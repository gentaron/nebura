### **Teacher’s Derogatory Commentary**

Circling Layla, the teacher jabbed her with the pointer, delivering a degrading monologue to strip away Ken’s respect for her:  
“Pink Voltage, such a sloppy woman. She strikes cool poses in the coliseum, but backstage, she’s a sweaty mess, scarfing down nutrition packs. These massive breasts? She whines about shoulder pain after fights. Pathetic.”  
The pointer grazed Layla’s chest, tracing the melted fabric.  

Sliding to her groin, the teacher continued:  
“This crotch draws every eye, but Layla’s too lazy to shower between matches, stinking of sweat. Did you know that, Ken? She’s not worth your admiration.”  
Layla’s face twisted, but Ken’s power silenced her protests.  

Tapping the submission emblem on Layla’s rear, the teacher sneered:  
“And this ass, swaying to drive men wild, yet she’s clueless about her allure. She’s a sinful tease, Ken, and you’re right to dominate her.”  

### **Ken’s Fall and Layla’s Resistance**

Ken absorbed the teacher’s words, fixating on Layla’s glistening, partially dissolved leotard and glowing emblems. The demonic slime permeated his bodysuit, nearly erasing his love for Rina and respect for Layla. His soul succumbed, his voice hollow:  
“Layla… you’re mine. Rina… I don’t need her anymore.”  

Layla clenched her teeth, her cybernetic system straining. Her gloves glowed blue, nanofiber creaking.  
“Ken…! Rina’s waiting…! Your heart’s still there…!”  
Her voice reached him faintly, but the demonic hypnosis crushed it.

### **Erotic Dance and Forced Confession**

The submission emblems pulsed, hijacking Layla’s cybernetic system. Released from her bonds, she began a seductive dance, her hips swaying rhythmically, pink twin-tails flaring like plasma. Her melted leotard clung tightly, emphasizing her breasts and buttocks.  

“Look, Ken… don’t you love how my body moves?”  
Her voice, manipulated by the demon, dripped with lasciviousness. The dance, reminiscent of her coliseum performances, was laced with heightened sensuality.  

Compelled to speak, Layla confessed fabricated sins:  
“Backstage… I stare at my body in the mirror, thrilled by the crowd’s gazes… I’ve fought matches without showering, the leotard clinging to my sweaty skin… I didn’t hate it…”  
Her face burned with shame, but the emblems forced her to continue.

### **Self-Applied Dissolver**

Under hypnosis, Layla grabbed the dissolver cream, sensually spreading it over her breasts, groin, abdomen, and arms. The leotard melted further, her skin glaringly visible.  
“Ken… see all of me… exposed for you…”  
Her dance intensified, the neon reflecting off her glossy body.

### **Sexy Boost and Stripping Dance**

Layla’s cybernetic system, corrupted by demonic power, amplified her movements. Her gloves and boots glowed, nanofiber vibrating to enhance her dance. She slid the leotard’s straps down, exposing more of her melted costume. Her stripping performance captivated Ken and the teacher, her curves swaying hypnotically.  

“Perfect, Pink Voltage!” the teacher crowed. “This is your servant, Ken!”  

### **Kneeling Submission**

At the dance’s climax, Layla dropped to her knees, prostrating herself. Her twin-tails brushed the ground, the melted leotard barely covering her. The emblems pulsed as she declared:  
“Ken… I’m your servant… Pink Voltage submits to you…”  

The teacher laughed triumphantly, but a flicker of Rina’s smile and Layla’s true strength stirred in Ken’s depths.

### **Escalating Torment**

Layla rose, her leotard slipping to reveal a hint of her nipple. Ken’s eyes blazed redder. Forced into a bowlegged stance, her hands locked to her hips, her groin and breasts were fully exposed. Slime surged from the ground, binding her legs and sapping her strength. A rotating tongue-saw, inspired by her Mirage battle, emerged beneath her groin, its jagged tongues targeting her clitoris with electric shocks. Layla’s body convulsed, her face collapsing into an ahegao expression.  
“Ugh… ah…!”  

The teacher began a sadistic commentary:  
“Behold Pink Voltage’s ahegao! This tongue-saw’s hitting her nerves. Look at her trembling breast, Ken! We’ll enjoy this hour-long endurance show!”  
For an hour, Layla endured, her body quaking under the relentless assault, her moans echoing.

### **Layla’s Defiance**

Despite her ahegao, Layla’s spirit flared. Her cybernetic system surged, gloves and boots glowing fiercely. Nanofiber cracked the slime bonds, and she struggled free, shouting:  
“Ken…! Rina’s waiting…! You were my fan…!”  

But Ken’s reinforced power restrained her again, the tongue-saw resuming its torment. The teacher mocked:  
“Pointless, Pink Voltage! Ken’s desires are ours!”  

### **Tense Standoff**

The plaza, bathed in neon and mist, was a stage of Layla’s humiliation and Ken’s corruption. The tongue-saw’s torment, the teacher’s taunts, and the pulsing emblems pushed Layla to the brink. Yet her unyielding spirit and Ken’s buried love for Rina flickered as faint hope. As the air warped, the next phase of their battle loomed.

### **The Ruined Plaza of Gigapolis**

The ruined plaza of Gigapolis pulsed with neon afterglow and purple mist, steeped in oppressive tension. Pink Voltage, aka Layla Virel Nova, was bound by the supernatural powers of Ken, possessed by the demonic Layla. Her sweat-drenched white leotard, partially dissolved by costume-dissolving cream, clung to her curves, with pink submission emblems glowing on her right buttock and left lower breast—symbols of her crushed pride. The bespectacled female teacher, a demonic doppelgänger, mocked Layla with a pointer, while Ken, his eyes glowing red, dominated her under the demonic slime’s control. Layla’s unyielding spirit resisted, but her situation was dire.

### **Erotic Dance and Forced Confession**

The submission emblems throbbed, hijacking Layla’s cybernetic system. Freed from her bonds, she launched into a seductive dance, her pink twin-tails flaring, her melted leotard accentuating her breasts and buttocks. Her hips swayed provocatively, taunting Ken and the teacher.  

“Look, Ken… don’t you love how my body moves?”  
Her voice, twisted by demonic hypnosis, dripped with lasciviousness, far from her usual self. The dance echoed her coliseum battles but was steeped in sensuality.  

Compelled by the demon, Layla confessed fabricated sins:  
“Backstage… I admire my sweaty body in the mirror, thrilled by the crowd’s stares… I’ve fought matches without showering, the leotard clinging to my skin… I liked it…”  
Her face burned with shame, but the emblems forced her words and movements.

### **Self-Applied Dissolver**

Under hypnosis, Layla seized the dissolver cream, sensually spreading it over her breasts, groin, abdomen, and arms. The leotard melted further, her skin glaringly exposed.  
“Ken… see all of me… bared for you…”  
Her dance grew fiercer, the neon reflecting off her glossy, near-naked form, overwhelming Ken and the teacher.

### **Sexy Boost and Stripping Dance**

The demonic force supercharged Layla’s cybernetic system, her gloves and boots glowing blue as nanofiber amplified her movements. She slid the leotard’s straps down, her stripping performance captivating like a coliseum spectacle. Her curves swayed, twin-tails arcing, her bare back glistening with sweat.  

“Perfect, Pink Voltage!” the teacher crowed. “Your servant, Ken!”  
Ken’s red eyes gleamed, his hypnotized mind drowning in Layla’s allure, his love for Rina and respect for Layla nearly erased.

### **Kneeling Submission**

At the dance’s peak, Layla collapsed to her knees, prostrating herself. Her twin-tails brushed the ground, the melted leotard barely covering her. The emblems pulsed, and she declared:  
“Ken… I’m your servant… Pink Voltage submits…”  

The teacher laughed triumphantly, but a flicker of Rina’s smile and Layla’s true strength stirred in Ken’s depths.

### **Escalating Torment**

Layla rose, her leotard slipping to reveal a nipple’s edge. Forced into a bowlegged stance, hands locked to her hips, her groin and breasts were exposed. Slime surged, binding her legs and sapping her strength. A rotating tongue-saw, reminiscent of her Mirage battle, emerged beneath her groin, its jagged tongues targeting her clitoris with electric shocks. Layla convulsed, her face collapsing into an ahegao expression, drool dripping.  
“Ugh… ah…!”  

The teacher began sadistic commentary:  
“Behold Pink Voltage’s ahegao! This tongue-saw’s wrecking her nerves. Look at her trembling breast, Ken! An hour-long endurance show!”  
For an hour, Layla endured, her moans echoing, her body quaking.

### **Layla’s Defiance**

Despite her ahegao, Layla’s spirit blazed. Her cybernetic system surged, gloves and boots glowing. Nanofiber cracked the slime, and she struggled free, shouting:  
“Ken…! Rina’s waiting…! You were my fan…!”  

Ken’s reinforced power re-bound her, the tongue-saw resuming its assault. The teacher sneered:  
“Pointless, Pink Voltage! Ken’s ours!”  

### **Rina’s Sudden Appearance**

The air shimmered, purple mist swirling. Rina emerged behind Ken, her pink hairpin glinting, her jumpsuit tattered but her eyes fierce. Escaping a demonic portal, she stunned Ken.  
“Rina…!? You…!?”  
His voice trembled, the red glow in his eyes flickering. Rina’s presence stirred his buried love and memories.

Layla, wracked by the tongue-saw, sensed Rina faintly. Her ahegao persisted, tongue lolling, twin-tails matted with sweat, her nipple peeking.  
“Rina… Ken…!”  
Her weak voice carried hope.

### **Tongue-Saw’s Transformation**

Ken’s gaze darted to Layla as the demonic Layla’s voice urged:  
“Ignore Rina, Ken! This is your everything!”  
The hypnosis tightened, and the tongue-saw morphed into a circular saw, its edges lined with tongue-like protrusions. Spinning slowly, each protrusion struck Layla’s clitoris with shocks and vibrations, her body spasming violently.  
“Uah…! K… ahh…!”  
Drool fell, her glossy skin reflecting neon, her ahegao deepening. The teacher exulted:  
“Pink Voltage, crushed by the saw’s tongues! Her pride’s shattered, Ken!”  

### **Rina’s Intervention**

Rina approached, grasping Ken’s trembling hand. Her warmth pierced his hypnotized heart.  
“Ken, wake up! This isn’t you! Believe in me!”  
Her plea rekindled his love for her and respect for Layla. His eyes wavered, the red glow dimming.  
“Rina… I…!”  
Confusion gripped him as the demonic slime tightened its hold.  

The teacher mocked Rina, jabbing Layla’s groin with the pointer:  
“Too late, Rina! Ken’s ours! Look at Pink Voltage’s ahegao—his desire incarnate!”  
Layla, writhing, locked eyes with Rina.  
“Rina… save… Ken…!”  

### **Tense Standoff**

The plaza, bathed in neon and mist, was a crucible of Layla’s torment, Rina’s plea, and Ken’s turmoil. The circular saw’s tongues ravaged Layla, her ahegao echoing. The teacher’s taunts fueled the demon’s grip, but Rina’s touch offered hope. Ken wavered between Layla’s humiliated form and Rina’s warmth, the hypnotic fog thinning momentarily.  

The air warped, signaling the next clash. Layla’s spirit, Rina’s love, and Ken’s soul teetered on the edge in Gigapolis’s dark heart.

### **The Ruined Plaza of Gigapolis**

The ruined plaza of Gigapolis shimmered with neon and purple mist, thick with lascivious tension. Pink Voltage, aka Layla Virel Nova, was bound in a bowlegged, provocative pose by Ken’s supernatural power. Her sweat-soaked white leotard, partially dissolved, revealed her skin, with pink submission emblems glowing on her right buttock and left lower breast. A rotating circular saw with tongue-like protrusions relentlessly targeted her clitoris, forcing Layla into an ahegao expression—tongue lolling, drool dripping, pink twin-tails matted—yet her eyes burned with defiance.

Rina, gripping Ken’s hand, pleaded to break his demonic possession. The bespectacled female teacher, a demonic doppelgänger, taunted Layla with a pointer, while Ken, freed from the demonic Layla’s hypnosis by Rina’s touch, wavered between awe and guilt. Layla’s unyielding spirit and Rina’s warmth kindled faint hope.

### **Obscene Torment of the Circular Saw**

The circular saw’s tongue-like protrusions churned with wet, obscene sounds, striking Layla’s clitoris with relentless precision. Each hit sent shudders through her, the melted leotard barely concealing her groin, its outline glaring in the neon. Her moans broke intermittently, fighting the demonic pleasure.  
“Uah…! K… ahh…!”  
Her ahegao deepened, drool falling, her body locked in a humiliating stance by slime restraints. The teacher jeered:  
“Look, Ken, Rina! Pink Voltage’s defenseless clitoris, shredded by the saw’s tongues!”  

### **Ken and Rina’s Gaze**

Ken and Rina, hands clasped, stared at Layla’s lascivious form. Rina, eyes gleaming with admiration and conflict, murmured:  
“So erotic… Layla, even like this… so strong…”  
Her grip tightened, anchoring Ken to reality.  

Ken, now free of the demonic slime, his eyes clear, gazed at Layla with renewed respect.  
“Layla… incredible… still fighting…”  
His voice mixed awe, guilt, and lingering fascination with her exposed nipple, glistening abdomen, and glowing emblems.

### **Layla’s Agonized Endurance**

Layla, wracked by the saw, pushed her cybernetic system to its limits. Her gloves glowed blue, nanofiber creaking, but the slime and saw held firm. Her eyes locked onto Ken and Rina.  
“Ken… Rina…! Believe in me…!”  
Her voice, though strained, carried fierce resolve. Ken and Rina, transfixed by her trembling form—nipple peeking, emblems pulsing—clung to each other, their faith in her unwavering.

### **Slime Cage and the Teacher’s Threat**

The teacher swung her pointer, and purple mist swirled around Ken and Rina. Slime erupted, hardening into a metallic cage that trapped them. Rina shouted:  
“Damn you, demon! What’re you planning!?”  

The teacher smirked, jabbing Layla’s groin:  
“This cage is demonic slime. Pink Voltage must defeat us to free you. Think this pathetic woman can save you?”  
She mocked the wet sounds of the saw’s assault.  

Ken, horrified, pounded the cage, cheering:  
“Layla! You can do it! Pink Voltage, don’t lose! Save us… save Rina!”  
Rina echoed:  
“Layla! We believe in you! Crush that demon!”  

### **Variable Saw and Layla’s Defiance**

The saw alternated speeds—rapid bursts hammering Layla’s clitoris with electric shocks, slow turns dragging out torturous pleasure. Her body spasmed, ahegao intensifying, but in a slow cycle, clarity returned to her eyes.  
“Ken… Rina…!”  
Her cybernetic system surged, gloves and boots blazing. Nanofiber screeched, and on her third attempt, she shattered the slime bonds with a crack, standing tall, twin-tails flaring, leotard glistening.  
“Demon…! I’ll save Ken and Rina!”  
Her voice thundered with Pink Voltage’s unbreakable spirit.

### **Descending Spiked Ceiling**

The air warped, and a massive spiked metal ceiling materialized, summoned by demonic power, descending to crush Layla, Ken, and Rina. The teacher cackled:  
“Pink Voltage, it’s over! This ceiling will crush you all!”  

Layla reacted instantly, overriding her cybernetic system. Blue energy erupted from her gloves, and she caught the ceiling with both hands, metal groaning. Her body trembled, sweat dripping, nipple exposed, emblems pulsing, but her eyes refused to yield.  
“Ken… Rina… escape…!”  

### **Ken and Rina’s Rally**

From the cage, Ken and Rina watched Layla’s struggle. Ken, shaking off fear, roared:  
“Layla! You’re invincible! We believe in you!”  
Rina shouted:  
“Layla! We’ll fight with you! Crush the demon!”  
Their voices fueled Layla’s resolve, her gloves glowing brighter, nanofiber vibrating beyond its limits.

The teacher, panicking, screamed:  
“Impossible! You can’t endure this!”  
But Layla held firm, her spirit overwhelming the demonic force.

### **Tense Endurance**

The plaza, bathed in neon and mist, was a battlefield of Layla’s endurance, Ken and Rina’s cheers, and the teacher’s scorn. The saw stopped, but the emblems and melted leotard intensified Layla’s ordeal. Trapped in the cage, Ken and Rina rallied behind her. The air warped, the final showdown looming. Layla’s strength teetered, but her will—and their faith—promised a miracle.

This translation condenses repetitive descriptions (e.g., Layla’s ahegao, the teacher’s taunts) and integrates new elements like the slime cage and spiked ceiling concisely. Let me know if you need specific sections expanded or further refined!

The ruined plaza of Gigapolis pulsed with the flickering glow of neon lights and swirling purple mist, steeped in an atmosphere of perverse tension and desperate struggle. Pink Voltage, Layla Virell Nova, stood defiant under the crushing weight of a massive, thorn-studded ceiling summoned by the monstrous slime’s dimensional power. Her sweat-soaked white leotard, partially dissolved by costume-dissolving cream, clung to her voluptuous curves, with the pink sigils of submission glowing ominously on her right buttock and left lower breast. Her pink twintails hung disheveled, and though her face had moments ago been contorted in an ahegao expression from the relentless assault of the spinning tongue-saw, her eyes burned with unyielding resolve. Ken and Rina, trapped in a hardened slime cage, clung to each other, their voices raised in fervent support for Layla. The monstrous female teacher, a manifestation of the slime entity, wielded her pointer with sadistic glee, taunting Layla’s plight.

### **Slime Envelops Layla**

As Layla strained against the colossal ceiling, her cybernetic-enhanced arms trembling under the strain, a new wave of purple slime oozed from the ground, thin and translucent, enveloping her upper body like a second skin. The slime slithered over her torso, coiling around her ample breasts and kneading them with deliberate, sensual motions. The dissolved patches of her leotard offered little resistance, and her right breast, with its partially exposed areola, quivered under the slime’s touch. Layla’s face tightened in defiance, but a faint gasp escaped her lips as the slime’s micro-vibrations sent shivers through her cybernetic nervous system.  
“Ken… Rina… I won’t… give in…!”  
Her voice was strained, yet resolute, as she fought to maintain her focus under the dual assault of the ceiling’s weight and the slime’s perverse manipulation.

### **The Cage’s Deformation**

Above Ken and Rina, the slime cage groaned as the descending ceiling pressed against its upper edge. The hardened, metallic slime began to buckle, deforming with a sickening creak. The cage’s structure held, but the narrowing space intensified their fear. Ken, his eyes now free of the monstrous Layla’s hypnotic red glow, gripped Rina’s hand tightly, his voice hoarse with desperation and hope.  
“Layla! You’re Pink Voltage! You can do this! We believe in you!”  
Rina, her pink hair clip glinting in the neon light, echoed his cry.  
“Layla, kick that monster’s ass! We’re with you!”  
Their cheers pierced the oppressive atmosphere, fueling Layla’s resolve as she braced against the ceiling.
