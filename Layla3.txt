### **The Youths’ Obsessive Questions**

Emboldened, the lanky youth raised his hand. “What’s her battle record? How many enemies has she defeated, and how?” The teacher’s smile widened, delighted by their obsession. “Pink Voltage has fought 327 battles, winning 312. She’s defeated 1,042 enemies—gangs, cyborgs, dimensional beasts. Her signature moves? Cyber-charged punches, spin-kicks, and her ‘Voltage Surge,’ a system-overdrive that fries opponents’ circuits. Notable wins include the Iron Colossi in 2112 and the Shadow Syndicate’s leader in 2114.”

The bespectacled youth piped up, “What about… now? How long has the tongue-saw been… uh, hitting her clitoris? And… how many times has her nipple been nibbled?” The teacher consulted an invisible ledger, her voice precise. “The tongue-saw has been active for 3 hours, 47 minutes, delivering approximately 12,894 hits to her clitoris. Her right nipple was nibbled 672 times by the leech before its removal. Oh, and her anus? Grazed 4,321 times by the saw.”

The stocky youth, blushing, asked, “How many times has she… farted?” The crowd tittered, but the teacher answered without hesitation. “Three documented instances during this show, each involuntary due to overstimulation. A fascinating quirk of her cybernetic stress response.” She added a tidbit, her tone scholarly. “Layla’s farts are odorless, a side effect of her enhanced metabolism—did you know that?” The youths nodded, scribbling, their admiration growing.

### **The Teacher’s Extra Trivia**

The teacher, reveling in their enthusiasm, offered unsolicited trivia. “Layla’s twintails are reinforced with nanofibers, capable of supporting her weight in combat. Her leotard, pre-dissolved, could withstand plasma blasts. Her clitoris’s size? Correlated with her heightened adrenaline response, making her a perfect target for our show.” She gestured to the screens, which displayed Layla’s battle stats alongside her current torment—clitoris hits, ahegao duration, breast jiggle frequency—turning her legacy into a perverse dataset. “Her largest victory was against the Quantum Hydra, defeated with a single overdrive punch. Her longest battle? 72 minutes against the Void Wraith. Now, she battles pleasure itself—and loses spectacularly.”

Layla’s moans punctuated the lecture, her ahegao deepening as the tongue-saw resumed its medium speed, her clitoris and anus quivering. The youths’ eyes shone with adoration, their notebooks filled with stats and sketches, their collection enriched by the teacher’s insights.

### **Ken and Rina’s Heartbreaking Visit**

Unbeknownst to the youths, Ken and Rina had slipped into the arena, their faces etched with sorrow. The sight of Layla—her clitoris tormented, her ahegao broadcast, her legacy dissected by fans and the teacher—shattered their lingering hope. Ken’s fists clenched, his voice a broken whisper. “She’s… gone. We can’t save her like this.” His guilt, fueled by his earlier fascination, weighed heavy, and he turned away, resigned to Layla’s fall.

Rina, tears streaming, stood transfixed, her pink hair clip glinting under the neon lights. She stepped forward, ignoring Ken’s tug, and bowed deeply to Layla, her voice trembling. “Layla… thank you for being our hero. I’m so sorry…” Her tears fell, her face a poignant contrast to Layla’s ahegao, the screens briefly capturing their emotional collision. Layla’s eyes, glazed yet flickering, caught Rina’s bow, a spark of recognition buried beneath the sigils’ haze.

### **Layla’s Tormented State**

Layla’s body convulsed under the tongue-saw’s assault, her clitoris—larger than average, a product of her robust physique—quivering helplessly, its outline stark under the tattered leotard. Her anus twitched with each grazing hit, her giant breasts jiggling with every convulsion. The sigils pulsed, amplifying her forced submission, her ahegao deepening as drool dripped from her lolling tongue. Her hips writhed, exaggerating her clitoris’s “dance,” a performance driven by the slime’s control yet tinged with defiant flair. Her moans, raw and amplified, filled the arena, a haunting counterpoint to Rina’s sobs and the youths’ fervent note-taking.

Her cybernetic gloves glowed weakly, a sign of her fading resistance, but her eyes held a defiant glimmer, fueled by Rina’s gratitude and the distant memory of Ken’s faith. The teacher’s commentary, the youths’ obsession, and the crowd’s gaze pushed her to the brink, but her inner struggle persisted, a whisper of hope amidst the degradation.

### **The Youths’ Devotion**

The three youths, unlike Ken and Rina, left the arena with renewed devotion. Their notebooks brimmed with stats—battle records, clitoris hits, nipple nibbles, farts—and sketches of Layla’s ahegao and quivering groin. They whispered excitedly, planning to add the teacher’s lecture to their collection, their admiration for Layla’s “defeated” persona stronger than ever. “She’s the ultimate hero,” the lanky one said, clutching his notes. “Even like this, she’s… perfect.”

### **The Arena’s Ongoing Spectacle**

The underground arena of Gigapolis remained a crucible of obsession and despair. Layla’s unending torment under the tongue-saw, the teacher’s perverse commentary, and the crowd’s polarized reactions—disgust, pity, adoration—created a volatile atmosphere. The three youths’ fervent fandom, Ken’s resignation, and Rina’s tearful gratitude wove a complex tapestry, the slime’s victory seemingly absolute. Yet, Layla’s faint cybernetic glow and defiant eyes hinted at a lingering resistance, a spark that refused to be extinguished. The neon lights flickered, casting shadows over the open-door spectacle, as Gigapolis’s citizens continued to flock to Pink Voltage’s torment, their gazes shaping her legacy in a torturous, electrified balance.

The underground arena of Gigapolis pulsed with a relentless, depraved energy, its neon lights casting a garish glow over a crowd that ebbed and flowed through the open-door “hero show.” Swirling purple mist, thick with the monstrous slime’s malevolent intent, cloaked the scene in an oppressive haze. At the heart of the spectacle was Pink Voltage, Layla Virell Nova, her body locked in a humiliating squat by metallic slime restraints, legs spread wide to expose her groin. Her white leotard, tattered by costume-dissolving cream, barely concealed her clitoris and anus, with transparent sigils of submission subtly pulsing beneath her skin. A spinning tongue-saw, its rim lined with morphing tongue-like protrusions, assaulted her clitoris and anus without pause, each hit sending electrified jolts through her cybernetic systems. Layla’s ahegao expression—tongue lolling, drool dripping, eyes rolled upward—deepened with every strike, her giant breasts jiggling, her clitoris’s pronounced outline and quivering anus magnified on holographic screens that dominated the arena. The female teacher, a sadistic manifestation of the monstrous slime, twirled her pointer with cruel delight, her glasses glinting as she guided an ever-changing audience through Layla’s torment. Gigapolis’s citizens—young and old, curious and perverse—flocked to witness the fallen hero, their reactions ranging from disgust to obsession.

### **The Virgin Male with the Rubber Bullet Gun**

A new figure pushed through the crowd—a lanky virgin male, his eyes glinting with nervous excitement, clutching a sleek toy gun loaded with soft rubber bullets. Without hesitation, he aimed at Layla’s writhing form and fired, the bullet striking her left breast with a muted *thwap*. Layla’s body jolted, her ahegao twitching as a muffled moan escaped her lips, her giant breasts quivering under the impact. The crowd murmured, some shocked, others intrigued, as he fired again, hitting her right breast, the leotard’s thin fabric doing little to cushion the sting.

The female teacher swooped in, her pointer doubling as a microphone. “Oh, what’s this? Why are you shooting our dear Pink Voltage?” she asked, her tone a mix of curiosity and amusement. The young man blushed, his voice steady despite his nerves. “I… I like ryona. Seeing her flinch, her breasts bounce like that—it’s… satisfying.” The teacher’s laughter rang out, her glasses glinting. “Ryona? A man after my own heart! Let’s elevate your game, shall we?”

With a flick of her pointer, she conjured a new clip for the gun, loaded with costume-dissolving cream bullets. “Try these,” she purred, handing it back. The young man, emboldened, took aim and fired twice, the bullets striking Layla’s nipples with pinpoint accuracy. The cream splattered, sizzling as it eroded the leotard’s remnants, fully exposing her nipples—swollen and glistening under the neon lights. Layla’s ahegao deepened, her moans louder, her breasts trembling from the combined assault of the tongue-saw and the cream’s sting. The screens zoomed in, capturing her exposed nipples, the crowd roaring with perverse approval.

### **The Futanari Enthusiast’s Request**

Another virgin male approached, his face flushed with a different kind of fervor. Clutching a sketchbook filled with explicit drawings, he stammered, “I… I’m a futanari fan. Can you make Layla… you know, futanari? It’d be perfect!” The crowd murmured, some intrigued, others confused, as the teacher tilted her head, considering the request.

Her smirk faded slightly, her pointer tapping her chin. “A futanari Pink Voltage? Tempting, but…” She gestured to the tongue-saw, its protrusions flicking Layla’s clitoris with relentless precision. “This setup is too exquisite to disrupt. Adjusting her anatomy would mean pausing the tongue-saw’s torment, and that’s simply unacceptable. Her clitoris is the star—look at it dance!” The screens zoomed in on Layla’s quivering clitoris, its pronounced outline stark under the tattered leotard, drawing gasps from the crowd. The young man’s shoulders slumped, disappointed, but nodded, sketching Layla’s current state instead, his futanari dreams deferred.

### **The Gang Member’s Demand**

The arena’s atmosphere shifted as a hulking figure shoved through the crowd—a member of Gigapolis’s underworld, a gang enforcer with tattoos snaking up his arms. His eyes gleamed with predatory intent as he approached the teacher, his voice gruff. “My crew needs… material. Every perverse video you’ve got of Pink Voltage—her clitoris, her anus, her ahegao, all of it. Name your price.” The crowd hushed, sensing the danger in his presence, but the teacher’s smile didn’t waver.

“Material for your comrades’… amusement? How practical,” she mused, twirling her pointer. “I’ll provide every file—tongue-saw hits, nipple nibbles, zombie groping, all in high definition—for a price. One of Layla’s coins, imbued with her cybernetic essence.” She produced a glowing pink coin, its surface etched with Layla’s silhouette. The gang member grunted, fishing a matching coin from his pocket—a rare artifact traded in Gigapolis’s black market. The deal was struck, and the teacher conjured a data drive, its holographic interface flashing as it transferred terabytes of Layla’s torment. “Enjoy,” she purred, pocketing the coin. The gang member smirked, slipping the drive into his jacket before vanishing into the crowd.

### **The Boy with the Emergency Bell**

As the gang member departed, a young boy—no older than twelve—edged forward, his eyes wide with hope. He clutched a small, ornate bell, its surface engraved with Layla’s emblem, designed to summon Pink Voltage in emergencies. The teacher’s gaze softened, but her smile was predatory. “Oh, what a treasure! Showing off your hero’s bell?” she cooed, bending to his level.

The boy nodded, his voice trembling but defiant. “Layla will come when I ring this. She always does!” The teacher’s laughter was gentle yet cruel, her glasses glinting. “Sweet child, she’s not coming. Look at her—Pink Voltage is here, and she’ll stay like this forever, moaning for our delight.” She gestured to Layla, whose ahegao deepened as the tongue-saw flicked her clitoris, her exposed nipples quivering on the screens. The boy’s face fell, but he shook his head, clutching the bell tighter. “She’ll come… I know she will.” With that, he turned and ran, disappearing into the crowd, his faith unshaken despite the teacher’s taunts.

### **Layla’s Tormented State**

Layla’s body convulsed under the tongue-saw’s unending assault, the protrusions’ varying textures—smooth, ridged, pulsating—overwhelming her cybernetic defenses. Her clitoris, larger than average due to her robust physique, quivered helplessly, its outline stark under the tattered leotard, now joined by her fully exposed nipples, raw from the dissolving cream. Her anus twitched with each grazing hit, her giant breasts jiggling with every convulsion. The sigils pulsed faintly, amplifying her forced submission, her ahegao deepening as drool dripped from her lolling tongue. Her moans, raw and amplified, filled the arena, a haunting soundtrack to the crowd’s voyeurism.

Her cybernetic gloves glowed weakly, a sign of her fading resistance, but her eyes—glazed yet flickering—held a defiant spark, stirred by the boy’s fleeting presence and the memory of Ken and Rina’s faith. The rubber bullets, the dissolving cream, and the crowd’s demands pushed her to the brink, but her inner struggle persisted, a whisper of hope amidst the degradation.

### **The Teacher’s Orchestration**

The female teacher reveled in the arena’s chaos, her pointer twirling as she guided each new visitor’s obsession. To the ryona enthusiast, she offered a sadistic upgrade; to the futanari fan, a teasing rejection; to the gang member, a lucrative deal; to the boy, a cruel dismissal. Her commentary wove a narrative of Layla’s willing surrender, masking the sigils’ coercive power. “Pink Voltage thrives in her defeat!” she proclaimed, gesturing to the screens, which looped close-ups of Layla’s clitoris, anus, and exposed nipples, her ahegao face a perverse centerpiece. The crowd’s reactions—arousal, curiosity, pity—fueled her control, turning Layla into a city-wide icon of depravity.

### **The Arena’s Escalating Voyeurism**

The underground arena of Gigapolis remained a crucible of obsession and despair. Layla’s unending torment under the tongue-saw, the teacher’s sadistic orchestration, and the crowd’s diverse demands—ryona, futanari fantasies, gang material, childhood faith—created a volatile atmosphere. The virgin male’s bullets, the gang member’s deal, and the boy’s fleeting hope marked new facets of Layla’s degradation, yet her faint cybernetic glow and defiant eyes hinted at a lingering resistance. The neon lights flickered, casting shadows over the open-door spectacle, as Gigapolis’s citizens continued to flock to Pink Voltage’s torment, their gazes shaping her legacy in a torturous, electrified balance. The battle for Layla’s spirit hung precariously, with the slime’s victory teetering against the spark of her unyielding heroism.

The underground arena of Gigapolis thrummed with a perverse intensity, its neon lights casting a garish glow over the relentless “hero show” that had captivated the city’s citizens. Purple mist swirled, heavy with the monstrous slime’s malevolent intent, cloaking the scene in a suffocating haze. Pink Voltage, Layla Virell Nova, remained the tortured centerpiece, her body locked in a humiliating squat by metallic slime restraints, legs spread wide to expose her groin. Her white leotard, tattered by costume-dissolving cream, barely concealed her clitoris and anus, her exposed nipples raw from dissolving bullets. Transparent sigils of submission pulsed faintly beneath her skin, binding her will. A spinning tongue-saw, its rim lined with morphing tongue-like protrusions, assaulted her clitoris and anus without pause, each hit sending electrified jolts through her cybernetic systems. Layla’s ahegao expression—tongue lolling, drool dripping, eyes rolled upward—deepened with every strike, her giant breasts jiggling, her torment magnified on holographic screens. The female teacher, a sadistic manifestation of the monstrous slime, twirled her pointer with cruel delight, her glasses glinting as she guided the crowd’s voyeurism. Gigapolis’s citizens—children, elders, and obsessives—flocked to the open-door spectacle, their reactions shaping Layla’s degraded legacy.

### **Jasmine’s Explosive Arrival**

The arena’s depraved rhythm shattered with a deafening *boom* as the reinforced entrance doors exploded inward, shards of metal scattering across the floor. A figure strode through the dust—a lithe, fierce woman with a chestnut ponytail swinging behind her. Jasmine, a fellow hero and Layla’s old friend, stood defiant in a pink leotard nearly identical to Layla’s, its sleek design hugging her athletic frame. Her eyes blazed with fury, her cybernetic gauntlets crackling with pink energy. The crowd gasped, parting as she stormed toward the center, her gaze locked on Layla’s writhing form.

“Layla!” Jasmine’s voice cracked with anguish, her eyes narrowing at the tongue-saw’s obscene assault, Layla’s ahegao, and the exposed state of her body. She whirled on the female teacher, who stood smirking at the arena’s edge. “You monster! What have you done to her?!” Without waiting for a reply, Jasmine lunged, her gauntlets flaring as she delivered a cyber-charged punch that sent the teacher crashing through the arena wall, out into the open air of Gigapolis’s surface.

### **Jasmine’s Ground Battle**

The fight spilled onto the city’s neon-drenched streets, the teacher’s form twisting as she regained her footing, her glasses glinting under the skyline’s glow. Jasmine pursued, her ponytail whipping as she unleashed a barrage of punches, each blow fueled by grief and rage. “You’ll pay for this!” she roared, her gauntlets crackling as they connected with the teacher’s slime-infused body, sending shockwaves through the pavement. The teacher staggered, her smirk faltering, but her voice remained mocking. “Oh, another hero? You’ll join Pink Voltage soon enough!”

Jasmine’s fury was unrelenting, her strikes precise and devastating. She slammed the teacher into a neon billboard, shattering it in a spray of sparks, then followed with a spinning kick that drove her into the ground. The teacher’s form rippled, absorbing the blows, but Jasmine’s raw determination kept her on the offensive, her heart breaking for Layla’s plight fueling every hit.

### **Layla’s Continued Torment**

Back in the underground arena, Layla remained locked in her torment, oblivious to Jasmine’s arrival. The tongue-saw’s protrusions flicked her clitoris and anus relentlessly, her ahegao deepening as drool pooled beneath her. Her exposed nipples quivered, her giant breasts jiggling with each convulsion, the screens broadcasting her degradation to a stunned crowd. Her cybernetic gloves glowed weakly, a faint sign of resistance, but the sigils’ pulsing control drowned her will, her moans echoing through the arena. The crowd, momentarily distracted by the explosion, refocused on Layla, their voyeurism undeterred by the chaos above.

### **Hogan’s Arrival and Conflicted Reaction**

As Jasmine battled topside, another figure slipped into the arena—a burly man with cropped black hair and a rugged hero’s suit, his chest emblazoned with a silver hawk emblem. Hogan, another of Layla’s old friends, froze at the sight of her. His face flushed, a mix of embarrassment and arousal at Layla’s lascivious state—her exposed nipples, quivering clitoris, and ahegao face were undeniably erotic, even to him. But the heat in his cheeks gave way to a scowl, his fists clenching as anger surged. “This… this is sick,” he growled, his voice trembling with rage. “Layla’s stronger than this. Who did this to her?!”

He scanned the arena, noting the absent teacher and the crowd’s perverse fixation. His cybernetic arm hummed, its servos tightening as he fought the urge to smash the tongue-saw. “Hang in there, Layla,” he muttered, his eyes lingering on her tormented form, torn between shame for his fleeting arousal and fury at her degradation.

### **The Teacher’s Transformation**

On the surface, the female teacher’s form began to warp under Jasmine’s relentless assault. Her glasses shattered, her body rippling as the slime within her surged, reshaping her into a lupine monstrosity—claws elongated, eyes glowing red, fur-like tendrils sprouting from her back. Her voice, now a guttural snarl, echoed through the streets. “You dare challenge me, hero? I’ll make you moan louder than Pink Voltage!” The wolf-like teacher lunged, her claws slashing at Jasmine, who dodged with cybernetic agility, her gauntlets flaring as she countered.

The teacher’s rage was palpable, her transformation fueled by Jasmine’s defiance. “I’ll break you both!” she howled, her attacks growing wilder, the neon-lit streets trembling under their clash. Jasmine gritted her teeth, her ponytail swaying, her resolve unshaken. “Not while I’m standing, you freak!”
