### **Pink Spark’s Rise**

Ken and Rina, inspired by Layla, launched “Pink Spark,” a startup offering affordable cybernetic AI for underbelly workers. Rina’s algorithms, drawn from Layla’s nanofiber tech, powered assistive devices, while Ken pitched to communities, using PINV coins for accessibility. “Like Pink Voltage, our AI helps you endure anything!” he’d say, echoing her Mirage fight resilience. Users grew, drawn to their vision.

On a rare day off, Ken toiled over sales docs in their mid-level office, exhausted. Rina, sensing his fatigue, surprised him in a Layla-inspired outfit—pink wig, leotard, cape, and boots, crafted with nanofiber sheen.  
“Hey, Ken! Pink Voltage, reporting! Ready to conquer sales?”  
She mimicked Layla’s pose, hand on hip. Ken dropped his papers, awestruck. “Rina… you’re like her!”  

Rina spun, cape flaring, mimicking Layla’s Colosseum moves. “You’re burning out, Ken. Let’s reignite that spark!”  
Her pose echoed Layla’s defiance, stirring Ken’s memories of her battles. “You’re amazing, Rina… like Layla, but you’re you!”  
She grabbed his hand. “Pink Voltage is our symbol. Let’s light up Gigapolis together.”  
Reinvigorated, they planned Pink Spark’s next steps, channeling Layla’s spirit.

### **The Monstrous Impostor**

Walking through the mid-levels, Ken and Rina discussed Layla’s latest fight, PINV chip in hand. Suddenly, purple mist rose, and a cackling “Kaiju” entity emerged, its translucent body writhing with tentacles. Before Ken could react, it snared Rina, dragging her into a violet portal. “Ken, help!” she cried, vanishing.

The portal reopened, revealing a figure mimicking Layla—pink twin-tails, leotard, cape—but with sinister red eyes. The Kaiju, shapeshifted, taunted, “Poor Ken, so weak. Want Rina back? Catch me.”  
It struck Layla’s poses, mocking her style to provoke him. “You loved her fights, didn’t you? Too bad you’re too pathetic to touch me.”  

Fury surged in Ken. “Give Rina back! Don’t mock Pink Voltage!”  
He grabbed a nearby pipe, charging, but the Kaiju jetted upward, laughing, and vanished into the portal. Ken, enraged, recalled Pink Spark’s tracking tech, inspired by Layla’s cybernetics.  
“I’ll save Rina and honor Pink Voltage!”  
Back at the office, he activated Rina’s tools, launching a program to hunt the Kaiju. Fueled by love for Rina and Layla’s spirit, Ken’s resolve burned, ready to fight under Gigapolis’s neon sky.

### **Tracking the Kaiju**

In Gigapolis’s shadowy underbelly, Ken clutched Rina’s cybernetic scanner, tracking the Kaiju’s dimensional portal. The device, powered by Pink Spark’s AI, pinpointed the monster’s purple energy signature. Fueled by resolve to save Rina and fury at the Kaiju’s mockery of Pink Voltage, Ken’s heart burned.

Purple mist swirled, and the Kaiju reappeared, mimicking Layla—pink twin-tails, gleaming leotard, flowing cape. Its red eyes gleamed with malice.  
“Ken, all alone in the dark? Impressive.”  
Its voice mimicked Layla’s warmth but dripped venom. It struck a pose, taunting, “You loved my battles in VR, didn’t you? Want to serve me?”  

Ken gripped the scanner, trembling with rage. “Return Rina! Stop defiling Layla’s image!”  
The Kaiju laughed, jetting upward and vanishing into a portal, leaving Ken to grit his teeth and recalibrate the scanner, vowing to press on.

---

### **The Kaiju’s Temptation**

Minutes later, the mist returned, and the Kaiju-Layla emerged, its form a perfect replica of Pink Voltage.  
“Ken, so persistent. I like that.”  
It taunted, striking Layla’s iconic poses with a sinister edge. “Join me, Ken. Say ‘I serve you,’ and Rina’s yours—along with my power.”  
Its red eyes locked onto him, voice honeyed but cruel.

Ken’s resolve wavered under its hypnotic gaze, but Rina’s smile and Layla’s courage flashed in his mind. “I won’t betray them!” he roared, charging with the scanner. The Kaiju dodged, vanishing into another portal with a mocking laugh. Ken, shaking off the temptation, refocused, determined to save Rina and protect Layla’s honor.

### **Hypnotic Ambush**

The mist surged again, and the Kaiju-Layla reappeared, its taunts sharper.  
“Ken, you can’t resist forever.”  
In a blur, it lunged, planting a cold, electrifying kiss on Ken’s lips, sending a jolt through him. “You said you’d serve me,” it whispered, red eyes morphing into hypnotic spirals. “Our contract is sealed.”  

Ken’s vision blurred as the Kaiju’s influence seeped in, urging him to command it. In a trance, he muttered, “Dance… like Pink Voltage, bold and fierce.”  
The Kaiju complied, mimicking Layla’s Colosseum moves—spinning, cape flaring, exuding power. Ken, entranced, saw Layla’s defiance overlaid, his heart torn.

It leaned close. “Want Rina saved? Or to control the real Pink Voltage?”  
Ken’s hypnotized voice betrayed him: “Save Rina… but defeat Layla… make her mine.”  
The Kaiju cackled, vanishing into a portal. “Grow stronger, Ken. Our contract holds.”  
Snapping free, Ken collapsed, horrified at his words. “Rina, Layla… I won’t fail!” He restarted the scanner, resolve reignited.

### **Encounter with the Real Layla**

In a neon-lit ruin, a pink flash heralded the real Layla Virel Nova’s arrival, her twin-tails glowing, leotard shining, cape swaying. On a charity mission, she recognized Ken.  
“Ken? My fan from before, right?” Her warm smile eased his turmoil.  

Before he could explain, purple mist erupted, and the Kaiju-Layla appeared, its red eyes mocking. Layla gasped. “A Kaiju… mimicking me!?”  
The Kaiju taunted, “Ken, show her our contract’s power!”  
Its form liquefied, merging with Ken’s Pink Spark suit, amplifying its hypnosis. His eyes glowed red, and he lunged, shattering Layla’s invisible cybernetic shield with a punch.  

Layla staggered, shocked. “Ken, it’s controlling you!”  
He struck again, sending her crashing into a wall, her leotard scuffed, hair disheveled. On her knees, she pleaded, “Ken, you’re my fan! Fight it for Rina!”  

Ken froze, Rina’s name piercing the hypnosis. The Kaiju’s voice urged him to dominate Layla, but her words and his loyalty to Rina and the real Pink Voltage sparked resistance. His eyes flickered, torn between control and defiance, as Layla’s unyielding spirit faced his inner battle in the neon-drenched ruins.

---

In the ruined plaza of Gigapolis, where the afterglow of neon lights flickered intermittently, Ken, possessed by the slime of the demon Layla, gazed at the real Layla Virel Nova, Pink Voltage, with glowing red eyes. Layla had crashed into a wall and fallen to the ground, her sweat-glistening leotard and disheveled pink twin-tails telling a story of pain and unyielding resolve. She tried to appeal to Ken, but under the demon’s hypnotic control, Ken merely sneered coldly and slowly raised his right hand.

### **Binding by Supernatural Power**

From Ken’s right hand surged a wave of purple energy, unleashed by the slime of the demon Layla, imbued with a supernatural force akin to divine power. It locked Layla’s body in an instant. She let out a cry of shock as she was forced to stand upright. Her spine straightened rigidly, her cybernetic body bound by an invisible force. Her pink twin-tails swayed, her white leotard stretched taut, and her voluptuous curves gleamed under the neon light. Layla strained to resist, but the demon’s power temporarily overwhelmed her nanofiber-enhanced system.

“Ken… stop…! You’re not this kind of person…!”  
Layla’s voice was desperate, but it didn’t reach Ken. The voice of the demon Layla echoed in his mind, stoking his desires.  
“Ken, have some fun. Control the real Pink Voltage as you please!”  

### **Layla’s Manipulation and Ken’s Desires**

Ken lightly moved his right hand, forcing Layla’s body to turn backward. Her red cape floated up under the supernatural force, drifting as if caught in the wind. Her ample buttocks, exposed through the leotard, shimmered with sweat, reflecting the neon light. In his hypnotized state, Ken reveled in the sight, his heart, dominated by the demon’s power, thrilling at Layla’s humiliating pose.  
“Pink Voltage… you look perfect like this…!”  
Ken’s voice was low, cold, and utterly unlike his usual self.

He moved his hand subtly, manipulating Layla into a pitiful, rigid stance. Her movements were awkward, like a marionette’s, balanced just enough to keep her from falling. Humiliation and anger flashed across Layla’s face. Each time her leotard stretched, emphasizing the lines of her chest and groin, Ken’s eyes glowed redder. The demon Layla’s voice egged him on.  
“Go on, Ken! Enjoy it more! Crush Pink Voltage’s pride completely!”  

### **Layla’s Resistance and Ken’s Inner Conflict**

Layla gritted her teeth, pushing her cybernetic system to its limits to break free from the demon’s bindings. Her gloves faintly glowed, and the sound of straining nanofibers echoed.  
“Ken… you want to save Rina, don’t you? The you who was my fan… wouldn’t want this…!”  
Her trembling voice, squeezed out from her bound body, reached the depths of Ken’s heart. Rina’s smile, Layla’s unyielding fight—these pierced through the fog of hypnosis, shaking Ken’s consciousness.

But the demon Layla’s slime seeped deeper into Ken’s bodysuit, the purple energy tightening around him. Ken, still staring at Layla’s buttocks, continued to obey the demon’s voice.  
“You’re mine… Pink Voltage…!”  
He waved his hand, manipulating Layla further, making her awkwardly spin once. Her cape fluttered, her buttocks swayed, and Ken’s desires peaked for a moment.

### **The Foreshadowing of Battle**

Layla’s eyes, even in humiliation, never lost their defiant spark. She overrode her cybernetic system, creating cracks in the demon’s supernatural hold.  
“Ken… it’s not too late! If you want to save Rina, fight with me…!”  
Her voice sparked a final resistance in Ken’s heart. His eyes wavered for a moment, the red glow weakening. But the demon Layla’s slime tightened around him again, reinforcing the hypnosis.

In the ruined plaza of Gigapolis, where neon lights flickered eerily, Layla’s bound form and Ken’s inner struggle clashed. Under the demon’s control, Ken manipulated Layla, but deep within, a battle to save Rina and protect the real Layla’s honor was beginning. As the air in the plaza warped again, signaling the next clash, Ken’s fate remained uncertain.

---

In the ruined plaza of Gigapolis, where neon lights flickered ominously, Ken, possessed by the demon Layla’s slime, held his right hand aloft, binding Pink Voltage, Layla Virel Nova, with supernatural power. Layla was forced into a rigid stance, her sweat-soaked white leotard accentuating her voluptuous curves. Her pink twin-tails disheveled, her red cape floating, her eyes still burned with unyielding resolve. For a moment, Ken’s love for Rina and Layla seemed to weaken the supernatural hold, but the demon Layla’s slime seeped deeper into his bodysuit, and the red glow reclaimed his eyes.  
“Don’t get weak, Ken. Make Pink Voltage completely yours!”  
The demon Layla’s voice echoed in his mind, reawakening his supernatural power.

### **The Slime Dogs and Layla’s Further Binding**

Suddenly, purple mist swirled in the plaza, and two slime-formed dogs materialized from the demon’s power. Their beastly forms, translucent and writhing, glared at Layla with red-glowing eyes. Layla pushed her cybernetic system to its limits to break free, but Ken’s reinforced supernatural power locked her body completely. She was forced into a provocative pose—hands on hips, legs slightly spread—her shattered groin protector leaving her vulnerable, her sweat-glistening buttocks exposed.  
“Ken… stop…! For Rina’s sake…!”  
Layla’s voice trembled but remained strong. But the slime dogs approached, their jagged tongues licking her groin and buttocks through the leotard. Layla’s body shuddered, her face a mix of humiliation and defiance.

The slime tongues sent faint electric shocks through her nervous system, disrupting her cybernetic enhancements. The leotard’s surface grew wet, further emphasizing her groin’s contours. Ken, in his hypnotized state, watched the scene, the demon Layla’s voice fueling his desires.  
“Look, Ken! Isn’t Pink Voltage’s pathetic state just perfect? Forget your love for Rina, your respect for Layla. They’re just toys!”  

### **Ken’s Gaze and the Demon’s Psychological Manipulation**

Ken stared at Layla as the slime dogs tormented her, their tongues making her leotard glisten and her pink twin-tails sway. The demon Layla appeared beside him, whispering in her own form.  
“Forget about saving Rina, Ken. Even the real Layla will kneel before you like this. Respect for her? You don’t need it.”  
The demon Layla placed a hand on Ken’s shoulder, her heart-shaped eyes and ahegao-like expression eroding his pure feelings for Rina and Layla.

Ken, gazing at Layla, was drawn into the demon’s words.  
“Layla… you’re… mine. Rina… I don’t need her…”  
His voice was low, his hypnotized desires taking form. The slime dogs licked Layla’s groin more persistently, her body trembling. Layla gritted her teeth, pushing her cybernetic system to override the demon’s power, but it held her down.

### **Layla’s Resistance and Ken’s Inner Conflict**

Layla endured the slime dogs’ assault, calling out to Ken desperately.  
“Ken…! Rina’s waiting…! Your heart… isn’t like this…! Believe in Pink Voltage…!”  
Her voice pierced the fog of hypnosis, stirring Ken’s mind. Rina’s smile, Layla’s unyielding fight—they flashed in his head. His eyes wavered, and his control over the slime dogs weakened. But the demon Layla wouldn’t allow it. Her slime seeped deeper into Ken’s bodysuit, the purple energy tightening around him.  
“Don’t waver, Ken! Dominate Layla completely! Rina’s just a burden!”  

Layla struggled to escape the slime tongues, her gloves glowing blue, nanofibers creaking.  
“Ken…! You loved Rina…! The you who was my fan… can still fight…!”  

### **The Tense Plaza**

In the ruined plaza of Gigapolis, Layla’s bound form and Ken’s inner struggle clashed. The slime dogs tormented her, the demon Layla eroded Ken’s heart, and his inner battle raged on. His love for Rina, his respect for Layla, and the demon’s temptations collided fiercely. As the neon lights flickered, Ken’s next move would decide Layla and Rina’s fate. The battle was far from over.

---

In the ruined plaza of Gigapolis, where neon lights flickered eerily, Ken, possessed by the demon Layla’s slime, held Pink Voltage, Layla Virel Nova, in a supernatural bind. Forced into a provocative pose—hands on hips, legs slightly spread—her sweat-soaked white leotard highlighted her voluptuous curves. Her pink twin-tails disheveled, her groin protector shattered, her ample buttocks exposed, two slime dogs tormented her as Ken watched in a hypnotized trance, the demon Layla’s voice eroding his heart.

### **The Serpent’s Tongue and Layla’s Reaction**

Suddenly, the slime dogs’ tongues transformed, becoming long, forked, and serpentine, their jagged surfaces turning into smooth scales. They slowly licked Layla’s groin and buttocks, weaving faint electric shocks into her nervous system to sap her resistance. Layla’s face contorted, looking upward in pain and humiliation. Her sweat-glistening leotard stretched tighter, emphasizing her groin’s contours. Her pink twin-tails swayed, a faint breath escaping her lips.  
“Ken… stop this…!”  
Her voice trembled, but her eyes never lost their defiant spark.

### **The Teacher’s Appearance and Erotic Commentary**

The mist swirled again, and a new figure formed beside Layla—a demon clone in the guise of a female teacher. Clad in a tight black suit, her voluptuous body contrasted with her stern expression and seductive smile. Holding a thin pointer, she lightly tapped Layla’s groin, tracing her inner thighs while delivering an erotic commentary to Ken.  
“Look, Ken. Pink Voltage’s groin is where her warrior strength and feminine allure collide. The taut lines of her leotard, the sheen of her sweat… perfect temptation.”  

Ken, hypnotized, circled Layla slowly, his gaze following the teacher’s commentary. The teacher moved her pointer to Layla’s buttocks, giving them a light tap as she continued.  
“This ample backside, the perfect balance of elasticity and softness. It drives the coliseum wild with every sway. Look at these curves… don’t you want to touch them?”  
She slid the pointer along Layla’s legs, back, and ample breasts, detailing their sensual allure. Each time Layla’s sweat-glistened back or constrained breasts were emphasized, Ken’s eyes glowed redder.

### **The Choice of the Crest of Submission**

The teacher finished her commentary and turned to Ken with a seductive smile.  
“Now, Ken. To make Pink Voltage fully your servant, you must engrave the Crest of Submission. Where will you place it? Her groin? Her chest? Or…?”  
She lightly poked Layla’s body with the pointer, making her tremble slightly. Layla gritted her teeth, pleading with Ken.  
“Ken… wake up…! Rina’s waiting…!”  

But Ken, still under hypnosis, answered coldly.  
“Her right buttock… that’s where the crest goes.”  
The teacher nodded with satisfaction, pressing the pointer to Layla’s right buttock. Purple mist gathered, and a pink, heart-shaped crest shimmered into her skin, adding a provocative accent to her backside. Layla’s body shuddered, her face flashing with humiliation.  
“Ken… you wouldn’t… do this…!”
