### **The Slime’s Mischief**

As Layla endured, the slime enveloping her torso grew bolder. Tendrils extended downward, slipping into the torn, dissolved patches of her leotard at her groin. With mischievous intent, the slime tugged at the frayed fabric, pulling it away to expose more of her skin. The barely intact material stretched and tore further, revealing the delicate contours of her groin, though her clitoris remained just concealed by a thin strip of fabric. The slime’s teasing pulls sent jolts through Layla’s body, her cybernetic systems struggling to counteract the sensation. She gritted her teeth, her twintails swaying as she fought to maintain her composure.  
“You… won’t break me…!”  

### **Layla’s Triumph Over the Ceiling**

For ten grueling minutes, Layla held the ceiling aloft, her arms trembling, the slime kneading her breasts, and its tendrils teasing her groin. Ken and Rina’s unwavering cheers bolstered her spirit, and her cybernetic systems pushed beyond their limits. Suddenly, the ceiling’s weight shifted—it became as light as polystyrene, its monstrous density an illusion crafted by the slime. With a defiant roar, Layla surged her energy, her gloves glowing blue as nanofibers vibrated. She thrust her arms upward, hurling the ceiling into the air. It shattered into harmless fragments, dissolving into the purple mist.

The plaza fell silent for a moment. Ken and Rina exhaled in relief, their faces lighting up with hope. Layla, panting heavily, turned to them with a weary but radiant smile. Her leotard was in tatters, her body marked by the sigils, but her spirit shone unbroken.  
“Ken… Rina… I told you… Pink Voltage never gives up.”  

### **Sudden Re-Locking**

As Layla stepped toward the slime cage, her hand reaching to free Ken and Rina, the air warped once more. The female teacher’s laughter echoed, and a surge of purple energy erupted from the ground. Layla’s body froze, her cybernetic systems overridden by the monstrous slime’s telekinetic power. She was forced into a rigid, upright stance, legs spread slightly, hands pinned to her hips in a humiliating pose. The sigils on her buttock and breast pulsed, reasserting their control.  
“No…! Not again…!”  
Layla’s voice was laced with frustration, her smile fading as she struggled against the renewed lock.

### **The Teacher’s Obsessive Gaze**

The female teacher stepped closer, her glasses glinting as she fixed her gaze on Layla’s groin. The torn leotard barely covered her clitoris, the thin strip of fabric clinging desperately to her skin. The teacher raised her pointer, hovering it just above the sensitive area, and began a perverse analysis with a mocking tone.  
“Oh, Pink Voltage, let’s examine this… delicate treasure. Your clitoris, hidden so precariously behind this shred of fabric—let me guess its features. It must be exquisitely sensitive, swollen from the tongue-saw’s torment, yes? I’d wager it’s petite yet pronounced, pulsing with every cybernetic surge. The way it quivers under pressure… it’s practically begging for attention, isn’t it?”  
She leaned in closer, her voice dripping with sadistic delight as she continued.  
“The size? Oh, just enough to catch every vibration, every touch. Its shape must be perfect, a little bud of defiance that betrays your body’s reactions despite your proud spirit.”  

Layla’s face flushed with humiliation, her body trembling under the telekinetic lock. The teacher’s words cut deeper than the slime’s assaults, but Layla’s eyes burned with defiance.  
“Keep… talking… monster. You’ll never… break me…!”  

### **Ken and Rina’s Desperation**

Inside the deformed slime cage, Ken and Rina watched in horror as Layla was re-locked. Ken’s earlier enthrallment with Layla’s lascivious plight had given way to fear and determination. He pounded on the cage’s walls, his voice raw.  
“Layla! Don’t let her get to you! You’re stronger than this! We’re here for you!”  
Rina, tears in her eyes, joined him.  
“Layla, you’re our hero! Fight it! We’ll get out of this together!”  

Their voices reached Layla, fueling her resistance. Her cybernetic systems flickered, the blue glow of her gloves intensifying as she strained against the telekinetic hold. The female teacher sneered, twirling her pointer.  
“Keep shouting, you two. It won’t change a thing. Pink Voltage is ours, and this cage is your tomb unless she defeats us!”  

### **The Ongoing Struggle**

The neon-lit plaza of Gigapolis remained a battleground of wills. Layla, locked in her rigid stance, endured the teacher’s humiliating scrutiny, her body marked by sigils and torn clothing. The slime’s earlier assaults had ceased, but the telekinetic lock and the teacher’s words posed a new challenge. Ken and Rina, trapped in their cage, poured their faith into Layla, their cheers a lifeline to her unyielding spirit. The air warped with the threat of further monstrous interference, and the battle for Layla’s freedom and Ken’s redemption hung in a precarious balance. The neon lights flickered, signaling the approach of another critical moment in their fight against the monstrous slime.

The ruined plaza of Gigapolis shimmered under the flickering neon lights, shrouded in swirling purple mist that pulsed with malevolent energy. Pink Voltage, Layla Virell Nova, stood locked in a telekinetic grip, her cybernetic-enhanced body forced into a humiliating stance by the monstrous slime’s power. Her white leotard, tattered by costume-dissolving cream, barely clung to her voluptuous curves, with pink sigils of submission glowing on her right buttock and left lower breast. Her pink twintails hung disheveled, and her face, moments ago defiant, now wavered under the strain of relentless assaults. Ken and Rina, trapped in a deformed, metallic slime cage, clung to each other, their cheers for Layla battling the oppressive atmosphere. The female teacher, a sadistic manifestation of the monstrous slime, wielded her pointer with cruel delight, her glasses glinting as she orchestrated Layla’s torment.

### **Layla’s Forced Pose and Renewed Assault**

The female teacher smirked, twirling her pointer as she channeled the slime’s telekinetic power. With a flick of her wrist, Layla’s body was manipulated further. Her hips were forced downward, squatting slightly, and her legs were spread wider, accentuating her vulnerability. Slime oozed from the ground, hardening into metallic tendrils that locked her legs in place, rendering her cybernetic strength useless. The torn leotard at her groin stretched taut, barely concealing her clitoris, which glistened faintly under the neon glow.  

From beneath Layla’s spread legs, a new spinning tongue-saw materialized, its circular form lined with tongue-like protrusions, each subtly different in texture and shape. The teacher’s voice dripped with mockery.  
“Behold, Pink Voltage, your next trial! This tongue-saw is special—each protrusion delivers a unique sensation, tailored to unravel your pathetic resistance.”  

The saw began to rotate slowly, and the first tongue-like protrusion grazed Layla’s clitoris, licking and flicking it with a wet, electrified touch. As it pulled away, the protrusion morphed slightly, its surface rippling to a new texture—some smooth, others ridged or pulsating. Each subsequent protrusion delivered a distinct pleasure, from sharp tingles to deep, throbbing pulses, overwhelming Layla’s cybernetic nervous system. Her clitoris, barely shielded by the tattered leotard, quivered helplessly under the relentless assault, its outline starkly visible with every flick.

### **Lotion and Splashing Torment**

As the tongue-saw spun, a thin layer of slick, glowing lotion seeped from the slime, coating Layla’s groin. The lotion amplified the sensations, making each protrusion’s touch slicker and more invasive. Droplets of the lotion splashed outward, one landing on Ken’s face as he stared from the cage. The warm, sticky sensation jolted him, a mix of horror and perverse fascination washing over him. The saw’s rotation settled into a moderate pace, each tongue-like protrusion striking Layla’s clitoris with deliberate precision, the wet, obscene sounds echoing in the plaza.  

Layla’s body trembled violently, her face collapsing into an unrestrained ahegao expression. Her tongue lolled out, drool dripping from her lips, and her eyes rolled upward in a haze of forced ecstasy. The sigils on her body pulsed rhythmically, amplifying the slime’s control. Her sweat-soaked skin glistened under the neon lights, the dissolved leotard exposing her areola and the curves of her hips.  

### **Ken and Rina’s Conflicted Emotions**

Ken and Rina, confined in their slime cage, watched the ecstatic spectacle with a torrent of conflicting emotions. Ken, his mind recently freed from the monstrous Layla’s hypnosis, felt terror and guilt surge within him. The sight of Layla’s lascivious torment—her quivering body, her ahegao face, the obscene movements of her clitoris under the saw’s assault—stirred a shameful fascination, yet his heart ached for her suffering. He gripped Rina’s hand, his voice trembling.  
“Layla… hold on! You’re stronger than this! We’re here for you!”  

Rina, her pink hair clip glinting, stared wide-eyed at Layla’s writhing form. The perverse beauty of the scene captivated her, but guilt and fear clawed at her resolve. She whispered, almost to herself, “It’s… so intense… but she’s still fighting…” Her words were laced with awe and dread, her hand tightening around Ken’s as they both grappled with the back-and-forth pull of horror and forbidden allure.

### **The Teacher’s Taunts and Layla’s Silence**

The female teacher circled Layla, her pointer tracing the air near her trembling groin. She leaned in, her voice a venomous purr.  
“Pink Voltage, how does it feel to be reduced to this? Speak! Tell us how much you love this pleasure!”  
But Layla could only moan, her voice drowned by the overwhelming sensations. The tongue-saw’s varying protrusions kept her clitoris in constant motion, each flick pushing her deeper into ecstasy. Her cybernetic systems flickered, unable to counter the slime’s invasive control. The teacher laughed, tapping her pointer against Layla’s thigh.  
“No words? Perfect. Your body speaks for you, you pathetic hero. Look at your clitoris, dancing for us!”  

### **Layla’s Struggle and the Plaza’s Tension**

Layla’s body convulsed under the saw’s relentless torment, her ahegao expression a stark contrast to her unyielding spirit. The sigils pulsed, the lotion glistened, and the neon lights cast an eerie glow over her writhing form. Ken and Rina, trapped in their cage, felt the weight of their helplessness, yet their cheers grew louder, urging Layla to fight. The teacher’s taunts echoed, but Layla’s silence—broken only by gasps and moans—hinted at her inner battle to reclaim control.

The air in the plaza warped, charged with the impending climax of this perverse ordeal. Layla’s cybernetic systems flickered faintly, her gloves glowing blue as she clung to her resolve. Ken and Rina’s faith in her, coupled with their own guilt and terror, fueled the tension. The monstrous slime’s power loomed, but the spark of Layla’s defiance—and the bond between the three—promised a turning point in the battle for their freedom.

The desolate plaza of Gigapolis pulsed with the erratic glow of neon lights, cloaked in swirling purple mist that carried the weight of malevolent intent. Pink Voltage, Layla Virell Nova, stood ensnared in the monstrous slime’s telekinetic grip, her legs spread in a humiliating squat, hands forced to her hips. Her white leotard, ravaged by costume-dissolving cream, clung precariously to her voluptuous form, with pink sigils of submission glowing on her right buttock and left lower breast. The spinning tongue-saw, its rim lined with morphing tongue-like protrusions, relentlessly targeted her clitoris, each hit delivering a unique, electrified sensation. Her ahegao expression—tongue lolling, eyes rolled upward, drool dripping—betrayed the overwhelming pleasure forced upon her, yet her eyes flickered with defiant resolve. Ken and Rina, confined in a deformed, metallic slime cage, gripped each other’s hands, their cheers for Layla clashing with the perverse spectacle. The female teacher, a sadistic manifestation of the monstrous slime, wielded her pointer with cruel delight, her glasses glinting as she orchestrated Layla’s torment.

### **The Teacher’s Sadistic Commentary**

The female teacher raised her pointer, signaling the tongue-saw to slow its rotation. The obscene, wet sounds of the protrusions flicking Layla’s clitoris softened, but the deliberate pace intensified the precision of each hit. The teacher turned to Ken and Rina, her voice a venomous blend of mockery and analysis.  
“Observe, you two. Why does Pink Voltage writhe so much more now than when her leotard was intact? Let me enlighten you.”  
She stepped closer to Layla, her pointer hovering near the tattered fabric barely concealing Layla’s clitoris. The dissolved leotard, now a mere shred, outlined the sensitive bud with stark clarity, its shape accentuated with every quiver.  

“When her costume was whole,” the teacher continued, “the tongue-saw’s protrusions couldn’t fully reach her clitoris. The fabric dulled the sensation, protecting her pathetic pride. But now—look!” She gestured at Layla’s groin, where the leotard’s remnants clung desperately, revealing the clitoris’s contours with every hit. “The torn fabric exposes her perfectly. Each protrusion delivers its full, exquisite stimulation across her entire clitoris. Every ridge, every pulse, every electrified flick—it all sinks in, overwhelming her cybernetic defenses. She’s utterly at our mercy.”  

The teacher’s pointer traced the air near Layla’s groin, emphasizing the obscene clarity of the exposed shape. The lotion coating her skin glistened, amplifying the visual and tactile assault.  

### **Layla’s Loss of Speech**

Layla’s body convulsed under the slowed tongue-saw’s torment, each protrusion delivering a distinct wave of pleasure that shattered her ability to form coherent words. Her ahegao face intensified—her tongue dangled, drool pooled at her chin, and her eyes fluttered in a haze of forced ecstasy. She tried to speak, to rally her defiance, but only broken gasps and moans escaped.  
“K-Ken… R-Rina… I…”  
Her voice dissolved into incoherent syllables, drowned by the relentless sensations. The sigils on her body pulsed rhythmically, their pink glow synchronizing with the tongue-saw’s rotations, deepening the slime’s control over her.

The female teacher laughed, tapping her pointer against Layla’s thigh.  
“Look at her, Ken, Rina! Pink Voltage has surrendered to the tongue-saw’s pleasure. She’s not fighting anymore—she’s *choosing* to give in!”  
She leaned in, her glasses reflecting Layla’s trembling form.  
“See those leg restraints? They’re not holding her down—they’re just supporting her body so she can fully embrace the ecstasy. Her cybernetic systems could break free if she truly wanted, but she’s too lost in this bliss!”  

### **Ken and Rina’s Despair and Defiance**

Ken and Rina, trapped in their slime cage, watched in horror as Layla’s body succumbed to the tongue-saw’s assault. The teacher’s words cut deep, sowing despair in their hearts. Ken’s earlier fascination with Layla’s lascivious plight had given way to guilt and terror, but her suffering reignited his resolve. He pounded on the cage’s walls, his voice raw with desperation.  
“Layla, don’t listen to her! You’re Pink Voltage! You’re stronger than this monster! We believe in you!”  

Rina, tears streaming down her face, gripped Ken’s hand tighter. Her voice trembled, torn between despair and hope.  
“Layla, you’re our hero! You can’t give up! Fight it, please!”  
Their cheers echoed in the plaza, a desperate lifeline to Layla’s fading resolve. The sight of her ahegao face, the obscene clarity of her clitoris under the torn leotard, and the teacher’s cruel taunts filled them with a sickening mix of back-and-forth emotions—horror at Layla’s degradation and guilt for their fleeting fascination.

### **Layla’s Tormented Ecstasy**

Layla’s body quivered as the tongue-saw continued its slow, deliberate torment. Each protrusion morphed subtly—some smooth, others ridged, some pulsating with micro-shocks—ensuring no two sensations were the same. Her clitoris, outlined starkly by the tattered leotard, danced helplessly under the onslaught, glistening with lotion and sweat. The neon lights cast an eerie glow over her writhing form, her pink twintails swaying with each convulsion. The sigils pulsed, amplifying the pleasure forced upon her, yet deep within, a spark of defiance flickered. Her cybernetic systems hummed faintly, her gloves glowing blue as she clung to the edge of her willpower.

The female teacher’s voice grew sharper, her taunts relentless.  
“See, Ken, Rina? She’s not your hero anymore. Pink Voltage is just a slave to her own body, reveling in this torment. Her pride, her strength—it’s all gone!”  

### **The Plaza’s Escalating Tension**

The neon-lit plaza of Gigapolis remained a battleground of wills. Layla, locked in her humiliating pose, endured the tongue-saw’s perverse assault, her clitoris exposed and tormented, her voice reduced to moans. Ken and Rina, confined in their cage, grappled with despair and guilt but refused to abandon their faith in Layla. The female teacher’s sadistic commentary and the slime’s unyielding control pushed the scene toward a breaking point. Layla’s faint cybernetic glow hinted at a possible counterattack, but the sigils and the tongue-saw held her in thrall. The air warped with the promise of another monstrous escalation, as the battle for Layla’s spirit and Ken and Rina’s freedom hung in a precarious balance.

The desolate plaza of Gigapolis shimmered under the erratic flicker of neon lights, cloaked in swirling purple mist that pulsed with malevolent intent. Pink Voltage, Layla Virell Nova, was trapped in a telekinetic nightmare, her body forced into a humiliating squat with legs spread wide, hands pinned to her hips. Her white leotard, ravaged by costume-dissolving cream, clung precariously to her voluptuous curves, with pink sigils of submission glowing on her right buttock and left lower breast. The spinning tongue-saw, its rim lined with morphing tongue-like protrusions, tormented her clitoris with deliberate, varying sensations, each hit amplified by slick lotion. Layla’s ahegao expression—tongue lolling, eyes rolled upward, drool dripping—revealed the forced ecstasy overwhelming her, though her eyes flickered with defiant resolve. Ken and Rina, confined in a deformed, metallic slime cage, gripped each other’s hands, their cheers for Layla battling despair and guilt. The female teacher, a sadistic manifestation of the monstrous slime, wielded her pointer with cruel delight, her glasses glinting as she escalated Layla’s degradation.
